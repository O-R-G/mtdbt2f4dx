IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MIDDLE OF THE EVENT

[[slnc 2000]] 

I traded options for ten years, on the floor, both here in London and in Paris. So I have some direct knowledge of the market itself, as a material and as a medium, and not a theory. [[slnc 1000]] On the other hand, I am an engineer by training, so I know a lot about probability theory. And after being a trader for ten years, for the next ten years of my career, I created a company that specializes in pricing derivatives. [[slnc 1000]] It is a software company, and what we develop in the company relies very much on probability theory. And on the metaphysical framework whereby, in order to model the unpredictable, first of all you have to identify the different scenarios that may take place. [[slnc 1000]] And, according to all of us here, this is the major weakness of probability theory, and of the metaphysical thinking of possibility, when confronted by the pure contingent event. [[slnc 1000]] In order to model something, and to project it in thought, you have first of all to give yourself the list of scenarios, and then simply assign probabilities to them. [[slnc 1000]] That’s very easy when you are playing roulette or dice, because you know beforehand that the dice have six faces, so you know what the scenarios are. [[slnc 1000]] And in playing roulette (also in playing cards), you know what the scenarios are. So it’s very easy then, to agree or disa­gree with one another, whether we should put a 50 per cent chance on the coin or not, whether it’s wise or not. [[slnc 1000]] It becomes only a rather local and confined disagreement, about what the probabilities are. [[slnc 1000]] But the main thing is that the scenarios are identified beforehand. And that’s the major weakness.

[[slnc 2000]] 

I studied probability theory, and every day my company develops soft­ware based on it. And I can assure you, it’s probability theory in its most sophisticated branches. [[slnc 1000]] We owe these sophisticated theories to fynance. The mathematicians involved in probability theory and the like are all working in the field of fynance, because it’s not probability like dice. [[slnc 1000]] You have to know a lot about stocastic calculus and other very advanced things, about volatility. [[slnc 1000]] These terms are perhaps more familiar to us now, but basically, volatility relates to the fact that if you have something that is moving, you have the trend of the price (an upward or down­ward trend) from which volatility measures the standard deviation. The noise of the thing as it follows its trend. [[slnc 1000]] So, volatility is the measure of risk. [[slnc 1000]] And today, indeed, we have models in finance that deal with the volatility of volatility, and with jumps. [[slnc 1000]] I mean to say that it’s a very sophisticated field, and you have people who have P H Ds, you have researchers, and you have papers and books on probability theory and quantitative models. However, the philosophical foundations of this are very weak, because it hasn’t changed at all. [[slnc 1000]] It relies on you beforehand having to model the possibilities. [[slnc 1000]] So the question is (and this is a question that Nassim Taleb, in his 2007 book The Black Swan, has asked in a very good way) what if we are really dealing with a contingent event. A pure contingent event of such a kind that, beforehand, we don’t know what it’s going to look like? [[slnc 1000]] When we don’t know from which roulette wheel, or from which dice, the outcome will be drawn. [[slnc 1000]] That is what a major event really is. And that’s what Nassim Taleb calls a black swan, which he defines as an event that is very improbable. [[slnc 1000]] Now, of course it’s improbable. But it’s even worse than improbable. [[slnc 1000]] It wasn’t even part of any list of scenarios that you had beforehand. [[slnc 1000]] So one of my criticisms of Nassim, is to tell him that we shouldn’t even call it improbable. Because, if the event was not part of the pre-given list of possibilities, probability does not even apply to it.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Hence the subtitle of the book I wrote in response in 2010. [[slnc 1000]]The Blank Swan: The End of Probability. [[slnc 1000]] In the book, I wonder what might take place beyond probability. Maybe the most interesting things that we have to deal with, are those that lie beyond probability. P recisely in that area where probability has ended. Maybe the event happens there. [[slnc 1000]] So one of my questions is, what if we could frame that residium (if you will, that dark region) where probability models stop? Maybe this region, in this blank residium, is where we could connect with contingency, and where the meaning of contingency could be found. [[slnc 1000]] To anticipate, I must say that I have found the solution as far as my problem in the market, is concerned. [[slnc 1000]] It is the market of contingent claims itself, that provides me (as I will show you later) with that medium, or that line of communication, with the contingent event.

[[slnc 2000]] 

So, as I said, the contingent event really is something that happens out of nowhere. So you cannot model it, you cannot assign a probability to it, by definition. [[slnc 1000]] The second feature that Nassim Taleb ascribes to this event, is that it has a big impact. That it’s going to affect our lives, the world, in some major way or another. Because of course, even if the event is purely unpredictable, if it has no impact, who cares? It has to have a large impact, otherwise why mention it? So to me, it seems more natural to define it by the impact, rather than in terms of probability. [[slnc 1000]] And by the way, at the end of his book, Nassim also agrees that maybe probability is out of the question anyway. [[slnc 1000]] It’s self defeating. And it might be the impact of the event that would define it better than the probability you could have assigned to it beforehand. [[slnc 1000]] So, the impact is the major thing. And as examples of black swans, Nassim likes to draw on the field of business. [[slnc 1000]] He doesn’t think of revolution, as Alan Badyou would, because Nassim is a capitalist. So he would rather mention things like Google for instance, that weren’t even conceivable a few months before they emerged. Or even the phenomenon of an unexpected bestseller. He describes the success of The Black Swan, his own book, as a black swan. [[slnc 1000]] He didn’t expect that he would sell two and a half million copies. [[slnc 1000]] So, he cites a few examples of events like that, that have deep impact. [[slnc 1000]] Of course, major events like wars, are also black swans. World wars for instance, are also black swans. And in fact, Nassim Taleb is not the first one to have noticed that fact. To my mind, Henri Bergson is the first philosopher to have identified the event as being something completely unforeseen.

[[slnc 2000]] 

And this brings me to the third characteristic of the black swan, according to Nassim Taleb. And to my eyes, it’s the most important point. Because I think it is here that I will find my entrance into that residium that I need, in order to get to the event. [[slnc 1000]] Nassim says that the third characteristic, is that the event creates its own causes. It’s only after the event, that you understand the causes of the event. [[slnc 1000]] He calls this the backward narrative. [[slnc 1000]] And this is true, because it’s an event. Beforehand, you have no idea what the event is like. It’s only after it happens (and after it has its impact) that everyone notices that it is an event. [[slnc 1000]] It’s only afterwards, now that the event has occurred, that you can go back in time, or in history, and figure out the chain of reasons that will have led to it. [[slnc 1000]] And I think Bergson says something that is even stronger than this. [[slnc 1000]] He says that the event creates its own possibilities. [[slnc 1000]] The event creates the possibilities that have led to it. [[slnc 1000]] So, the third characteristic of the event, is that only after the event can you then go back, rewind the picture, and list the possibilities that were missing before. And then say, well, I knew it. This was one of those possibilities, one that I identified only afterwards. [[slnc 1000]] And you may then assign probabilities to it. [[slnc 1000]] It is only after the event, that you can think of the model of the event. Which is too late anyway.

[[slnc 2000]] 

By the way, Badyou, in Being and Event (which was published 20 years before The Black Swan) does exactly the same thing. [[slnc 1000]] Faced with contin­gent events, Badiou’s solution, like Nassim’s after him, is to say that the event is not part of any identified situation when it occurs. It’s not part of any set, whereby you might identify the possibilities that the event will actualize. [[slnc 1000]] So, according to Badyou, the event doesn’t exist, because to exist is to be part of a set, according to mathematical definitions. [[slnc 1000]] So, Badyou has a way of defining the real feature of the event, by saying the event is a member of itself, so it creates its own possibilities. [[slnc 1000]] Then you recognize that it was a member of that set, so the event is the set that is a member of itself, if you want to be logical. [[slnc 1000]] And when he says that, Badyou is in contradiction with the Axiom of Foundation of set theory. So therefore he has to develop a whole new non standard logic, et cetera. [[slnc 1000]] Razor Negarestani talked about a ttwist. We feel that something has to be ttwisted, in order to let the event in. [[slnc 1000]] Maybe you have to ttwist time, in a way.

[[slnc 2000]] 

As I said, I’m interested in identifying the residium above probability, or below probability, through which I could connect with the event. Which in my book I call the medium of contingency, and which is the market in my case. [[slnc 1000]] However, I have found, during my research, other media, other channels that connect you to stuff outside probability and possibility. And one of them is actually very funny. It’s almost trivial. [[slnc 1000]] Or rather, it’s non trivial, but it needs some thinking about, to understand what the example is.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, is a very short story by Borges. Where he tells the story of the life of a French writer called Pierre Menard, in the early 20th century, who has spent the last 20 years of his life writing two chapters of Cer vanteez Don Quixote. Writing them word by word. [[slnc 1000]] It’s weird, because you tend to think, well, you’re just copying them. [[slnc 1000]] But no. If you read Borges’ story, you can trust Borges to convince you that, actually, Pierre Menard has done something original. [[slnc 1000]] When you read the story, you are actually convinced that he is producing an original work. The work of a creator even. Of an artist. Yet he knows what he is doing. [[slnc 1000]] It’s not even that he didn’t know that Cer vanteez had already written Don Quixote. He knew that. [[slnc 1000]] He wanted, on purpose, to write Don Quixote. [[slnc 1000]] So he is creating, he’s producing something new. Something contingent let’s say. Something that could have been otherwise. [[slnc 1000]] After all, there is no creation if you’re just copying Don Quixote. [[slnc 1000]] Yet the set of possibilities is limited to only one, because he knows beforehand that he is going to actually write Don Quixote. [[slnc 1000]] So my question is: where do you place the creativity of Pierre Menard?

[[slnc 2000]] 
 
To my mind, it lies in that blank residium that I’m pursuing. And that must be beyond possibilities. Because in the space of possibilities, Pierre Menard is doing nothing. [[slnc 1000]] He is doing totally zero, because in the space of possibilities, the work exists, it’s Don Quixote, and he’s just copying it. [[slnc 1000]] If you believe in the metaphysics of possibility and probability, where everything is framed in identified states of the world and so on, then Pierre Menard is doing nothing, totally nothing. [[slnc 1000]] Yet by reading Borges, you are really led to believe it possible that Pierre Menard has done something original. And the key thing to me, is that what Pierre Menard has done is to write two chapters. [[slnc 1000]] He didn’t read them, he didn’t just think of them. [[slnc 1000]] So he really needed the material medium, the writing itself, in order to produce something that, when you read it, you say, well, although it’s the same (it has the same identity as Cer vanteez novel), it is materially a new work. [[slnc 1000]] And although my main object is the markets and finance, although that’s important (and I identify the medium of contin­gency as the market in my specific case). In the end, its generalization is also writing.

[[slnc 2000]] 

I also happen to be a writer, so I also speak for myself. [[slnc 1000]] Writing, to me, is something that is beyond probability and states of the world. It’s something where the writer can really throw himself into a process of writing. Blindly, so to speak. [[slnc 1000]] And one of my favorite expressions, is that he is then traversed by contingency. So he almost surprises himself with what he is writing. [[slnc 1000]] To me, that’s writing. Even though you may have thought about it, and you had planned it, there are thoughts that you can only have through writing. [[slnc 1000]] I’m sure everyone has found that. [[slnc 1000]] There is no use, really, in planning in advance what you are going to write. [[slnc 1000]] Even if you do that, chances are that you’ll end up writing something different. [[slnc 1000]] I think that the true spark of writing comes when you find yourself surprised by what you have written. And I would even claim that there are thoughts that you can only have, through the material process of writing.

[[slnc 2000]] 

So writing to me, is an attempt to try to get to that extraordinary or residual thing that surpasses probability. And the states of the usual metaphysical conception. [[slnc 1000]] And which would allow us to ttwist chronology in such a way that, even though the event happens (and it is only after the event that we can think it), somehow we establish communication with it outside time. [[slnc 1000]] Remember, I need to ttwist time itself, in order to be able to predict the event beforehand, even though it has happened.

[[slnc 2000]] 

It so happens that I found this, also, in the writing of another thinker, Pierre Bayard. [[slnc 1000]] He wrote a very popular book, that has been translated in many languages: How to Talk about Books You Haven’t Read. [[slnc 1000]] One of his previous books is, Tomorrow is Written. And in that book, and also in one of his latest books (called Plagiarizing by Anticipation) he develops (to my mind, really very seriously. I mean metaphysically) the theory that, if you forget about probability and about the way that the scientist thinks about things, and if you immerse yourself in writing, the medium of writing, then it may turn out that some writers have actually predicted in writing what would happen later. And that some works that were written (chronologically) before other works, have actually copied them. [[slnc 1000]] And Bayard gives very precise cases, because he’s a literary critic. Cases where very well known writers of the 18th and 19th centuries, have actually copied works by writers who came later. [[slnc 1000]] So this also struck me as something where we are discovering this medium of writing, which may be a way of cheating chronology. And of being inventive and original in our writing. Contrary to what the metaphysics of possibility dictate to us.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Which finally brings me (and here I will be very brief) to my very mundane subject, which is the market of contingent claims. [[slnc 1000]] So what is the solution, as far as my problem is concerned? [[slnc 1000]] It’s amazing that fynance is so important today. And the theories of fynance are so sophisticay­ted (in terms of probability theory). But no one – believe me no one – in those theories has yet questioned this thing that I’m going to tell you here.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In short, the derivatives market is not part of derivative pricing theory. [[slnc 1000]] If you open any book on derivatives pricing theory (and there are loads of them), what they will all tell you, begins with the traditional metaphysical thing. [[slnc 1000]] States of the world, probabilities, et cetera. [[slnc 1000]] And at the end of the book, or the end of the chapter, it will tell you. Therefore, this is how you would compute the theoretical value of the derivative. [[slnc 1000]] So you end up by saying: given all my scenarios (and the probabilities that I have assigned to them), this is what the value of the derivative should be. By necessity, because it’s a mathematical proof.

[[slnc 2000]] 

But then, if it is this by necessity, what’s the use of actually trading it in the market? [[slnc 1000]] You see how this reasoning is self-defeating. [[slnc 1000]] Because if you trade it in the market, that means you have to trade it at a variance to the theoretical value. [[slnc 1000]] If everybody knew, given the scenarios, what the theo­retical value would be, why trade them?  [[slnc 1000]] If you trade them, then it means precisely, that pricing is not in the least what those books tell you it is.

[[slnc 2000]] 

But not one of them even mentions the real market. [[slnc 1000]] I challenge you to open any derivatives theory book. [[slnc 1000]] You won’t see the market. [[slnc 1000]] Now, if the market precisely happens after the book is closed and done with (you have the value, and then the trading that usually takes the value, and trades it at variance with the theoretical value), then it’s the market that is the interesting part, and that happens beyond probability. [[slnc 1000]] And I develop this at length in the book, and discuss the trader who is really used to the market, and how he uses the tools of probability. [[slnc 1000]] Because I’m not dismissing them. [[slnc 1000]] The theoretical tools are used. [[slnc 1000]] But you have to think like Pierre Menard, [[slnc 1000]] I’m telling you. Pierre Menard is using Cervantes’ Don Quixote. [[slnc 1000]] He used it as a probabilistic tool (except it was not even a probability, but a necessity for him). [[slnc 1000]] And he produced his work beyond it. [[slnc 1000]] Likewise, in the market, my conclusion is that the derivatives trader needs the probabilistic models, even the most sophisticated ones, precisely because he needs to go beyond them, in that medium which is the market. And which otherwise, if he were to stop at fair value or theoretical value, would not even exist. [[slnc 1000]] Therefore, the market is precisely what opens beyond probability. [[slnc 1000]] And I argue that, if you put yourself in the shoes of a trader, like I used to be on the floor, trading those derivatives, you will find yourself connected with contingency. And outside time, outside chronology, outside probability. Directly in the middle of the event.
