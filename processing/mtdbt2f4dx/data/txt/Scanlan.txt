23 THOUGHTS ABOUT dirt

[[slnc 2000]] 

1. [[slnc 1000]] The poet and playwright Friedrich Schiller, used to keep a batch of rotten apples under the lid of his writing desk.

[[slnc 2000]] 

2. [[slnc 1000]] Whenever his thinking became impacted, he would lift the lid, breathe in the sweet brown rot. And his mind would loosen up again.

[[slnc 2000]] 

3. [[slnc 1000]] Marcel Duchamp performed a similar service, with a few rotten apples of his own. [[slnc 1000]] A urinal. A snow shovel. A bicycle wheel.

[[slnc 2000]] 

4. [[slnc 1000]] Whenever art has felt itself in a quandary, unsure of its social value or what (if anything) should happen next, a whiff of the ready mades has made things possible again.

[[slnc 2000]] 

5. [[slnc 1000]] The problem now, is that the ready mades are no longer rotten.

[[slnc 2000]] 

6. [[slnc 1000]] The original ones (whatever that means) actually did rot. [[slnc 1000]] That is, they served their purpose, and were discarded, and new rotten apples took their place. A stuffed goat. A can of excrement. Some cowboys.

[[slnc 2000]] 

7. [[slnc 1000]] As is often the case???(and in fact, as is the modus operandy of art museums),???at different times, it has been useful to rescue these objects from destruction.

[[slnc 2000]] 

8. [[slnc 1000]] The conflict between the museo logical desire for permanence, and the creative catalysis of decay, has animated sculptural practice ever since.

[[slnc 2000]]

[[slnc 2000]] 

10. [[slnc 1000]] John Cage once described the role of silence in his work, by saying that it was like a glass of milk. [[slnc 1000]] You need the glass. And you need the milk.

[[slnc 2000]] 

11. [[slnc 1000]] For Cage and his collaborators, this way of paying attention had a political dimension. In that it minimized the importance of the artist, at the same time that it welcomed coincidences from the wider world.

[[slnc 2000]] 

12. [[slnc 1000]] It was, and is, fundamentally egalitarian to hold that, because a car horn and a French horn both make sounds, both are capable of being musical.

[[slnc 2000]] 

13. [[slnc 1000]] We should apply this outlook to the production of artworks.

[[slnc 2000]] 

14. [[slnc 1000]] If every bit of matter in the universe could have a turn at being art, then the conflict between permanence and destruction would become irrelevant. Since all matter, at all times, would be on its way to becoming an artwork. [[slnc 1000]] And all artworks would be on their way, to becoming something else.

[[slnc 2000]] 

15. [[slnc 1000]] We could put to rest, forever, the boring question of whether some??thing is art or not. [[slnc 1000]] Instead, we would only have to wonder whether it was art, at that moment.

[[slnc 2000]] 

16. [[slnc 1000]] Our only concern as artists would be to keep things flowing, and to invent new images and forms for everything to flow through. [[slnc 1000]] So that even??chewally those new images and forms could enter the flow, too.

18. ???Eye con Earth??? is one such invention. A brand of potting soil that was produced in Birmingham, England, under the auspices of the Eye con Gallery.

[[slnc 2000]] 

19. [[slnc 1000]] The idea was to collect precise categories of postconsumer dater???(i.e. garbage) ???from the shopkeepers of Birmingham. Pass it through the Ikon Gallery as if the museum were a kind of refinery. And then sell it back to the people of Birmingham as an exclusive local brand.

[[slnc 2000]] 

20. [[slnc 1000]] The price was ??7.99 for a six liter bag. Pretty expensive for potting soil. But pretty cheap for a work of art. Especially one that, if properly exhibited, could produce gladiolus, or Brussels sprouts.

[[slnc 2000]] 

21. [[slnc 1000]] When the Yale University Art Gallery purchased 29 bags of Eye con Earth through my website, I needed to get some palettes on which to make the shipment. [[slnc 1000]] In the pages of the You-line catalogue, I found a shipping palette that was made of recycled materials. [[slnc 1000]] When the palettes arrived, and I began stacking the artworks onto them, a beautiful thing happened. [[slnc 1000]] I noticed that both items had,???at other times,???taken the form of other things. A wall. A digital file. A fish. A tree. [[slnc 1000]] And now here they were, fixed in the exact moment that their material trajectories were intersecting in space.

[[slnc 2000]] 

22. [[slnc 1000]] Before the museum placed its order, the materials that make up Homage to John Cage???existed. But Homage to John Cage itself did not exist.

[[slnc 2000]] 

23. [[slnc 1000]] Things had to happen in a certain way, in order for the artwork to become visible. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

24. [[slnc 1000]] It was like a glass of milk.
