It Just Had Something To Do With New York

[[slnc 2000]] 

Our story begins in nineteen 61, with billionaire art collector and New York State Governor Nelson Rockefeller. And peripatetic critic and architect Philip Johnson. [[slnc 1000]] The two men were connected through the Museum of Modern Art. [[slnc 1000]] Rockefeller???s mother had co founded the institution and Johnson was the first director of its architecture department. [[slnc 1000]] When Rockefeller asked Johnson to design the New York State Pavilion for the nineteen 64 New York World???s Fair, his only instructions were to make the host state???s structure the tallest at the global expo. [[slnc 1000]] The resulting pavilion,???which still exists (partially dilapidated and partially as a working theater)???was a multipart complex whose main structure was somewhere between a classical ruin and a circus tent. [[slnc 1000]] It featured the world???s largest terrazzo map of New York State sheltered by the Tent of Tomorrow, an oval roof of brightly colored translucent plastic panels suspended many feet above. [[slnc 1000]] Three yellow disc shaped observation decks, each higher than the last (supported by concrete columns), towered over the tent. [[slnc 1000]] Finally, there was the circular Theaterarma, built to contain a panoramic film of New York State.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Johnson invited ten up and coming artists, some of whom he collected personally, to produce new work for the Theaterarmas featureless gray exterior. [[slnc 1000]] These artists were Peter Agostini, John Chamberlain, Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander Liberman, Robert Mallary, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol, who had opened his first New York exhibition of Pop paintings in November nineteen 62, just a month before the New York State Pavilion work was commissioned. [[slnc 1000]] Johnson had purchased Warhol???s nineteen 62 Gold Marilyn, out of this exhibition. Probably on the advice of his life partner, David Whitney, who, 30 years his junior, was what we would now call an independent curator and major taste maker in his own right. [[slnc 1000]] Johnson would donate it to the Museum of Modern Art very soon after.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In planning the exterior of the Theaterarma, Johnson had invited each artist to produce a new work for a 20???by???20 foot slot, to be spaced all around at regular intervals on the exterior wall.  [[slnc 1000]] For his contribution, Warhol chose to enlarge the mugg shots of the New York Police Department???s 13 most wanted criminals of nineteen 62. Silkscreen them on square Maysonite panels. And tile them together into an animated black and white rogues gallery which, along with the other works, would overlook one of the fair???s central byways. [[slnc 1000]] All of the works were installed by April 15, nineteen 64. [[slnc 1000]] But after triggering objections at the high est level,???Thirteen Most Wanted Men ???was painted over with silver paint a few days later.  [[slnc 1000]] When the fair opened to the public on April 22, all that was visible was a 20???by???20 foot silver square, mounted on the concrete structure between a fragile looking white sculpture by Agostini. And a colorful combination of advertising imagery by Rosenquist.

[[slnc 2000]] 

That July, Warhol reused the muyral???s silkscreens to make a set of paintings, each featuring one of the???Thirteen Most Wanted Men. [[slnc 1000]] He abandoned the square format of the fair tiles, in favor of ???40???by???40 inch canvases that emphasized their presence as portraits. [[slnc 1000]] In title ing these new, individual works, 20 of which were made altogether (some were made in triplicate, some doubled, and others are unique),???he also returned to the source material for the first names, initials of last names, and numbers of the criminals themselves. [[slnc 1000]] Before moving on to other work, Warhol produced a replacement for the New York State Pavilion piece. [[slnc 1000]] 25 Maysonite panels each depicting the smiling face of New York City planning mastermind and World???s Fair president Robert Moses. [[slnc 1000]] This was rejected immediately by Johnson,???who said he didn???t think they should thumb their noses.???And though consigned to Castelli Gallery at the end of that summer, these works were subsequently lost. [[slnc 1000]] Although there is no evidence that Moses had anything to do with the commission, or the covering over of the myural, Warhol appeared to be identifying him as the myural???s censor. [[slnc 1000]] The 75 year old Moses???s conservative cultural attitudes, his destructive urban renewal policies, and, specifically at the fair, his refusal to remind the building trades of the desegregation laws that were on the books, generated much anger among New Yorkers from Grinitch Village to Harlem. [[slnc 1000]] The fair presidency was a kind of consolation prize for Moses??? loss of other public offices,???which had been orchestrated by Nelson Rockefeller, the only man powerful enough to do so. [[slnc 1000]] After 40 years of reigning over New York???s public realm, he had become for many a kind of Public Enemy number 1.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The fair was open from April to October of both nineteen 64 and nineteen 65, and the square, silvery blank that had been???Thirteen Most Wanted Men,???stayed up for both of those seasons. [[slnc 1000]] In a New???York???World Telegram???article from summer nineteen 65, headlined Silver Square So Nothing It Satisfies Warhol, the artist is described standing before the myural at the World???s Fair with members of his entourage, saying that the silvered over version is, more mee now. [[slnc 1000]] Through typical, jesting Warholian attitudinal alchemy,???Thirteen Most Wanted Men ???had become a new work in the form of a silver monochrome. [[slnc 1000]] Indeed, the blank appears frequently in his work and words. [[slnc 1000]] He added identically-sized, single color panels without imagery to a selection of the Disaster paintings. And in many other works of that period, he left areas of the canvas untouched. Including a section of Thirteen Most Wanted Men. [[slnc 1000]] The number of individual images (22) did not match the number of panels that would make up a grid (25), so he simply left three squares at the bottom edge empty. [[slnc 1000]]  Not just comfortable with the void but personally identified with it, Warhol also wished later that his gravestone be left blank,???then adjusted this statement to say that it should, rather, say the word, figment.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The works on the New York State Pavilion were commissioned in December nineteen 62, and announced with one line descriptions for each, and no illustrations, in the New???York???Times???on October 6, nineteen 63. [[slnc 1000]] It was during precisely this period that Warhol was re-purposing imagery of suicides, car crashes, an electric chair, and protestors clashing with police. Which he found in the news media, as subjects for paintings now known as the Death and Disaster series. [[slnc 1000]] The first Disasters serially repeat dreadful scenes of dismemberment,???a body impaled on a telephone pole, a foot next to a car tire, bodies hanging out of car windows amidst crumpled steel. [[slnc 1000]] Others repeat an image of an empty electric chair in nineteen 63. The same year that New York State, after banning capital punishment, performed its last two executions. [[slnc 1000]] The Race Riots, also considered part of this body of work, reproduce a series of photographs of a police dog tearing off a civil rights pro tester???s trouser leg. Three frames of humiliation unfolding, as the civil rights movement was gaining strength, assisted by media exposure of exactly this type of violence.

[[slnc 2000]] 

According to poet John Jorno, it was at a dinner party in April nineteen 63 (just weeks before the photograph of the Birmingham protests that Warhol used for Race Riot would be published in Life magazine), that painter Wynn Chamberlain suggested the most wanted men as subject matter for Warhol???s World???s Fair commission. [[slnc 1000]] Chamberlain reportedly offered to ask his boyfriend, a policeman with the NYPD, to bring Warhol a stash of police department printed matter for inspiration. [[slnc 1000]] Indeed, a handy pocket sized police department printed booklet containing the mug shots, aliases, crimes, fingerprint classifications, and other identifying information for the N Y P D???s Thirteen Most Wanted of nineteen 62, was found in Warhol???s Time Capsules, along with examples of the kind of F B I wanted posters, that were apparently on view in post offices at that time. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s Time Capsules consist of approximately 600 boxes of life related ephemera, accumulated by the artist since the mid nineteen 60s. Whose cataloguing over the past 20 years by The Andy Warhol Museum, has allowed much insight into his work. [[slnc 1000]] Thirteen Most Wanted Men,???is frequently mistakenly thought to be based on the F B I???s most wanted. But Warhol???s usual deadly precision is in evidence in his choice of the N Y P D booklet. [[slnc 1000]] In line with his interest in seriality and repetition, Warhol chose the readymade collection of men over the single criminal. And, better to represent his city and state, focused on local rather than national fugitives from justice. With the possible result that New York City visitors to the fair might have recognized a family member or neighbor in the dubious group. [[slnc 1000]] When quizzed about the piece by a reporter for a New???York Journal American article published April 15, nineteen 64 (the day the mural went up), Warhol said, It just had something to do with New York. [[slnc 1000]] As usual, there was New York City, sexy dangerous and ungrateful, sticking its finger in the eye of New York State. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Warhol???s New York gallerist, Eleanor Ward of the Stable Gallery, did not show or sell the works in the Disaster series. [[slnc 1000]] Ileana Sonnabend showed them in Paris in January nineteen 64, in an exhibition Warhol had wanted to title, Death in America. [[slnc 1000]] Too hot for New York, the Men canvases themselves, were also shown for the first time together at Sonnabend???s Paris gallery, three years after the incident at the fair. [[slnc 1000]] In the exhibition booklet for this nineteen 67 exhibition, the???Thirteen Most Wanted Men???are dated to nineteen 63, rather than nineteen 64. Emphasizing their connection to the Disaster series and other work that year, and deemphasizing their connection to the World???s Fair. [[slnc 1000]] Inside is an essay by art critic Otto Hahn, with an epigraph by Robert Delaunay. La photo, eh un art criminellll. [[slnc 1000]]  Thirteen Most Wanted Men???s unusually long gestation,???only a year or so less than the time required to plan the World???s Fair itself,???meant that a work generated during Warhol???s most provocative period (whose results had not been seen by New Yorkers even within the protected confines of an art gallery) would have ended up, had the mural remained, in the most visible venue of its day. [[slnc 1000]] Its covering over in silver, effectively brought it up to date in his own work and life. [[slnc 1000]] Silver was the color with which Billy Name was covering every possible corner of Warhol???s new studio, which would become known as the Factory, into which he had moved in January nineteen 64. [[slnc 1000]] Although absent from the fair, the images of the???Thirteen Most Wanted Men???in the form of acetates hanging on walls and over windows, served as a backdrop to activity at the Factory. At least through nineteen 65.

[[slnc 2000]] 

But as much as these works,???with their black and white palette, and their disturbingly seductive imagery, of violence as captured by a cruel camera???are Disasters, they are also portraits. [[slnc 1000]] During the same period, Warhol produced his first portrait commission, nineteen 63???s Ethel Scull Thirty Six Times. Based on a session with the socialite in a Times Square photo booth. [[slnc 1000]] The final product was a wall of shots of his subject???s head and shoulders, re-ordered into a multicolored grid of animated poses. [[slnc 1000]] Like the mugg shot, a photo booth picture is an industrial or workaday as opposed to fine art photographic format, whose multiple frames resemble a segment of film. A medium into which Warhol had recently plunged.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Also in January nineteen 64, Warhol began shooting the Screen???Tests, three minute long portraits in 16 millimeter film. [[slnc 1000]] The very first series of these,???which could be said to be the inspiration for all of the Tests (which eventually numbered 472),???were titled???Thirteen Most Beautiful Boys. [[slnc 1000]] As identified by Callie Angell, this conceptual series, which continued into nineteen 66, but was concentrated in nineteen 64, eventually comprised 42 portraits of 35 young men, ranging from underground film star and poet Taylor Mead, to dancer Freddie Herko, to poet and artist John Jorno, to Factory photographer Billy Name, to actor Dennis Hopper, to someone noted only as Boy. [[slnc 1000]] In an unpublished interview conducted for Angell???s Andy Warhol Screen Tests, Billy Name says that the work was the title,???a perpetually open ended group that could always be added to, like any other collection. [[slnc 1000]] The Boys???and Men???share more than the first part of their title. [[slnc 1000]] In the Tests??? very process, in which a subject is placed under bright lights, and requested to stay as still as possible for three minutes, we also find a hint of law enforcement???s punishing constraints.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Warhol???s identification with criminals and other transgressors, as well as his artistic deployment of the state structures that discipline and punish them, can be read in the context of his own sexuality, and that of his peers. [[slnc 1000]] At a time when the expression of gay sexuality, either between people or in media, was illegal, all references to it had to be in code. [[slnc 1000]] Thirteen Most Wanted Men has, in fact, been persuasively decoded by art historian Richard Meyer and others. And now we can read the double meaning in its punning reference to ???wanted men.??? [[slnc 1000]] We can also see the active glances going on amongst those men in their mural configuration, and pick up the work???s reference to rough trade, or desirably threatening forms of masculinity. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol coded his early films as well, from Eat,???to Empire, to the Screen???Tests, he generally preferred visual and verbal puns on sex acts to showing forbidden body parts. [[slnc 1000]] In a letter to a traveling Warhol, probably from spring of nineteen 65, Billy Name informs him about a police department visit to the Factory in search of 13 Most. A likely reference to either???Thirteen Most Beautiful Boys, or???Thirteen Most Beautiful Women, a companion group of Screen???Tests. [[slnc 1000]] But had law enforcement viewed what they were after, they would have seen only an anonymous series of quiet faces. [[slnc 1000]] This contrasts strongly with the explicit Flaming Creatures from nineteen 63, whose far less politic author, underground filmmaker Jack Smith, was one of Warhol???s main inspirations as he took up filmmaking. [[slnc 1000]] Flaming Creatures was a lightning rod for police enforcement of obscenity laws, especially in the run up to the New York World???s Fair in spring nineteen 64. [[slnc 1000]] During the summer of nineteen 63, Warhol had made what may have been his first film on the set of Smith???s second film, Normal Love. [[slnc 1000]] On March 3, nineteen 64, a Jonas Mekas organized screening of Flaming Creatures, which had Warhol???s three minute newsreel of Normal Love on the bill as well, was raided, and all films and equipment confiscated and never returned. [[slnc 1000]] Protesting this and other shutdowns, on April 22, nineteen 64 (the opening date of the World???s Fair),???a group of artists and poets including Taylor Mead, Alan Marlowe, Diane di Prima, Julian Beck, Allen Ginsburg, and others marched from Bryant Park, to the newly constructed Lincoln Center, where they dumped a coffin marked: Will Free Expression be Buried? Next to the fountains adjacent to the New York State Theater, another Philip Johnson building, that would open officially the following day.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In one of the comparatively few newspaper articles that reported the covering up at the time, Philip Johnson claimed that it had been Warhol???s decision to paint over the mural, and that official objections were not, and would never have been, the deciding factor. [[slnc 1000]] In another, he claimed that due to the length of time that had elapsed, one of the criminals had been pardoned, and they wanted to avoid lawsuits. [[slnc 1000]] Here it???s worth quoting at length (despite the inaccuracies),???an unpublished interview that the prominent curator and close Warhol friend Henry Geldzahler conducted with Johnson in nineteen 82.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Henry Ggeld zahler:

[[slnc 500]] 

Philip, we???re going to end this with a story that perhaps hasn???t been printed before. [[slnc 1000]] In nineteen 64, for the New York World???s Fair, you did the New York State Building. [[slnc 1000]] And you commissioned Andy Warhol to do 10 paintings,???enormous ones, 20???by???20 feet, for the exterior of this building. [[slnc 1000]] A very daring commission, because Andy was not the enormous Pop figure in 64 that he has become. And yet somehow those paintings disappeared overnight. [[slnc 1000]] What happened? 

[[slnc 500]]

Philip Johnson:

[[slnc 500]]

It was a very sad story. [[slnc 1000]] He chose, unbeknownst to me, but I don???t care. [[slnc 1000]] I gave each artist a chance to pick his own subject. And he picked, impishly,???the ten most wanted men. Their heads would be about 15 feet. [[slnc 1000]] And I thought, That would be an absolutely delicious idea. [[slnc 1000]] Why not? He used the F B I list we used to see in Post Offices (we don???t anymore),???of the ten most wanted names. [[slnc 1000]] And I thought nothing of it until I got a call from Renay de Harnoncore, that the Governor wished to have it removed, just before the show opened.

[[slnc 500]]

Henry Ggeld zahler:

[[slnc 500]]

Did it have anything to do with the high number of a certain ethnic group that was in the top ten?

[[slnc 500]]

Philip Johnson:

[[slnc 500]]

It had all to do with the fact that 9 out of???10 names that were all from???

[[slnc 500]]

Henry Ggeld zahler:

[[slnc 500]]

A certain part of the world.

[[slnc 500]]

Philip Johnson:

[[slnc 500]] 

Yes. Well, the Governor wanted to be elected in the worst way, and this never crossed my mind, so I didn???t check with him. [[slnc 1000]] The Governor by the way, helped us pay for that personally.

[[slnc 500]]

Henry Ggeld zahler:

[[slnc 500]]

The first part or the second part?

[[slnc 500]]

Philip Johnson:

[[slnc 500]]

Well, he didn???t help pay for Andy, no. [[slnc 1000]] But there were lots of other artists. [[slnc 1000]] And the Governor was most, most helpful. [[slnc 1000]] But they weren???t painted over,???they were removed. Eventually all the canvases were removed. [[slnc 1000]] They don???t still hang there. The Rauschenberg is in the Dallas museum.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Renay de Harnoncore was the director of the Museum of Modern Art. [[slnc 1000]] As a trusteee of that museum, New York State Governor Nelson Rockefeller was also de Harnoncore???s boss. [[slnc 1000]] Johnson was probably MoMA???s most influential ex-employee, the designer that same year of the renovation of its signature garden, and a major donor. [[slnc 1000]] His mention of the F B I, rather than N Y P D, might be Johnson misremembering, or it might have been his real understanding of Warhol???s intentions at the time. [[slnc 1000]] But the phrase absolutely delicious, calls up both Johnson???s deep attitudinal alignment with Warhol. In an interview with Billy Kloover and Julie Martin he calls him mayshont, meaning naughty. He said, Andy???s was the one the governor turned down. He was a mayshont boy that time, echoing the indulgent tone of this interview???s impish, and his surprising political nie ev ehtay, which had had incalculably worse results 30 years earlier, before and during World War II.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The ethnicity that dared not speak its name was Italian American. Seven out of 13 of the Men ???had Italian names, indeed an important potential constituency for Rockefeller. [[slnc 1000]] But Warhol???s elevation of career criminals (with all their bruises and booking numbers)???to the facade of a building, which existed explicitly to promote a positive image of New York State to a predicted 40 million visitors, would seem to be reason enough to have the mural removed. Especially for a Northeastern moderate running for the Republican nomination for US president, against a much more conservative opponent. At a moment when New York City was experiencing a well publicized rise in its crime rate. [[slnc 1000]] And it may be that Rockefeller???s extraordinary role as a supporter of art and artists, as well as his liberal views generally (not to mention his involvement in the destruction of Diego Ri veras mural at Rockefeller Center in nineteen 34)???prevented him from saying openly that it was outrageous, and had to go. [[slnc 1000]] Indeed, the World Telegram???article in which Warhol is quoted affirming the silvered-over work as a more accurate reflection of himself begins with a reference to???Thirteen Most Wanted Men???as having been, deemed inappropriate for a Fair. [[slnc 1000]] Here the reporter seems to be taking for granted that the various explanations provided in the press the year before, were specious. And leaps to the most obvious conclusion,???and the one that may be, viscerally, the truest.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Everyone remained friends. [[slnc 1000]] Nelson Rockefeller was New York State governor until nineteen 73. And though he was the one who gave the order that the mural must go, in nineteen 67 he commissioned Warhol to do his own portrait. And in nineteen 68, one of his wife, Happy. [[slnc 1000]] Johnson, occupied at the time not only by the New York State Pavilion but by the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center,???funded in part by Rockefeller???s o???ce and made possible by Robert Moses???s urban renewal policies (and the new garden at the Museum of Modern Art) almost certainly worked with Warhol to select silver, as the color to paint over???Thirteen Most Wanted Men. [[slnc 1000]] Johnson remained an important ally of the artist, and a collector of his work. Commissioning his own portrait in nineteen 72, for which Warhol used a photograph taken in the summer of nineteen 64 as source material.

[[slnc 2000]] 

All this is just background. An account of various aspects of the forces at work on an artist famous for refusing to describe his own motivations. [[slnc 1000]] Perhaps however, it provides the essence of the story, without taking the place of an artwork that is above all, a gesture. A powerful act that supersedes words.
