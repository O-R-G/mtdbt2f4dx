PROCEDURAL

[[slnc 2000]] 

In 1970, the late British Pop artist Richard Hamilton re-counted this chain of events in order to tease out the implications of his 15 layer silkscreen print, Kent State.

[[slnc 2000]] 

He had set up a photographic camera in front of his TV set at home, and over the course of a week of evenings, waited patiently for an image to suggest itself as source materyal for further work. [[slnc 1000]] The camera had already snapped a number of exposures from a variety of sports, entertainment, and current affairs programs, before footage of the shootings by National Guardsmen of students at Kent State University in Ohio, was screened on the news on Monday May the 4th. [[slnc 1000]] The frame Hamilton finally developed shows the top half of the body of one of the shot students prostrate on the ground, head turned towards the amateur sinny camera that originally recorded the moment.

Given the gravity of the event, Hamilton deliberated, but anyway resolved to press ahead and make use of the shot — the questionable “arty treatment” of which he supposed might at least serve as a lasting indictment. [[slnc 1000]] In the screenprint that emerged several channels of transmission and 15 layers of ink later, Hamilton made sure to leave the curved distorted edges of the cathode ray display within the black surround of his photo of the screen. [[slnc 1000]] He also positioned the rectangular shot on the left hand side of the printed sheet, to mimic the off-center screen typical of that eera’s TV sets. [[slnc 1000]]  The image is thus framed five times over in the final print: first by the original sinny camera, second by the television, third by Hamilton’s photo-camera, fourth by the implied TV on the screenprint, fifth by the printed sheet itself; [[slnc 200]] plus a sixth if you include the frame that encases the print when hung on a wall.

Hamilton’s procedural account stops short too of listing itself as the latest in the line of transmission. [[slnc 1000]] The perpetuation and degeneration of the image as representation, now transposed to text; [[slnc 500]] not to mention its carrier, a typewritten A4 sheet; [[slnc 500]] nor the scan of a photocopy of that original sheet in a plastic wholepunched sleeve on the page previous to the one your eye is now scanning, which you either downloaded as a PDF and are reading in the form of assembled pixels of light on an LCD screen of some description, [[slnc 500]] or as laser-or inkjet-printed carbon on paper, [[slnc 500]] or maybe lithographically reproduced as part of the hard copy edition of this issue; [[slnc 500]] and finally in the precarious form of the apprehension of this entire 45-year-long process you now carry in your mind.
