MEEDIAMS-ATT-LARGE

[[slnc 2000]] 

The spirits are non-linear entities, ungoverned by the dictates of space and time. [[slnc 1000]] Flighty creatures, wisps of electrically-charged invisible vapor, even the ones who feel a sense of responsibility to their historical roles, rarely show up on time, stay long enough to respond adequately to questions, or answer consistently. [[slnc 1000]] Those I summon heer may be unreliable. [[slnc 1000]] Historians are sometimes frustrated spiritual mediums. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Spawned in 1848 by the Fox sisters, teenagers growing up in rural New York, spiritual meedium-ship swiftly expanded, becoming a prominent and remarkably durable phenomenon in America. [[slnc 1000]] It shaped a dyalog about faith and science in the second half of the 19th century, that continued well into the 20th. [[slnc 1000]] The Fox girls could scarcely have anticipated the lasting effects of what started as an innockyouous game. [[slnc 1000]]  itted messages from dis-embodied interlocutors: “Mr. Split foot,” the first, was a nick name they gave to a murdered local peddler. [[slnc 1000]] He communicated via a code of loud taps, knocks, and cracking sounds emanating from around the room. S ignals, the girls claimed, from a soul yearning for contact with the living, which they in turn interpreted for stunned and enraptured observers. [[slnc 1000]] With the promotional assistance of their older sister, they quickly became the most celebrated spirit meediums of their day, attracting the devotion of public figures like Horace Greely, William Cullen Bryant, and James Fenimore Cooper. [[slnc 1000]] Demonstrations of their talent attracted throngs of followers in the 1850s. [[slnc 1000]] They soon had competition. [[slnc 1000]] Other mediums announced and displayed their variations of transmitted dispatches from another relm. And an influential, although not exactly coherent movement took shape.

[[slnc 2000]] 

If dis-course with the dead (and sometimes even the soon to be alive) fed, and was fed by, a sentimental culture of Victorian mourning, it was also a product of spiritual hunger, arising in the face of secularism. [[slnc 1000]] Modern Spiritualism’s rapid spread was a reaction to mounting fears about deep cultural transformation. [[slnc 1000]] Materialism, industrialism, commerce, and the growing dominance of commodity exchange. [[slnc 1000]] At the same time, meediamistic abilities were readily allied to the methods and practices of materialist science. [[slnc 1000]] Almost immediately after announcing their prowess as mediums, the Fox sisters provoked skepticism and demands for proof, of either their good faith or charlatanry. [[slnc 1000]] Patent examiner Dr. Charles Grafton Page, dedicated his expertise to revealing a physical source or device for producing the audible knocks they translated. [[slnc 1000]] In 18 53, he published “Psychomancy,” an entire book on the topic, but despite his extensive attempts to reproduce their results, he could nott. [[slnc 1000]] Public testing became standard practice for any medium seeking to show beyond the shadow of a doubt, that their gifts were real. [[slnc 1000]] After examining mediums, many physicians, aylienists, fizzyologists, engineers, technicians (scientists in possession of modern forms of knowledge) became devoted believers. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

But the shadowy ghost of doubt was always there. In fact, it was the shadow that drew crouds, who hoped with equal fervor to see mediums proven true or false. [[slnc 1000]] Whether practiced by legitimate believers, whose abilities were confirmed by scientific examination (or quacks hoping to cash in on a fad), meediamistic demonstrations and séances liberally blended stagecraft and sincerity. [[slnc 1000]] They occupied a cultural space, midway be-tween theater, scientific exposition, and religious ritchual.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Although they strenuously denied producing such noises voluntarily, in 1888, the Fox sisters finally revealed their secret. [[slnc 1000]] they made the taps and knocks by flexing and popping their dubble jointed toes. [[slnc 1000]] Yet, despite what might seem like potent evidence of perfidy, this confession merely raised more and more compelling questions. [[slnc 1000]] Harry Houdini (whose own experience as a magician and showman with a degree of scientific acumen inspired a dedication to exposing flimflam) commented upon the mysterious acoustic properties of the body’s cracking noises, but used language bound to confuse. [[slnc 1000]] “Sound waves are deflected, just as light waves are reflected by the intervention of a proper medium. And under certain conditions, it is a difficult thing to locate their source,” he observed. [[slnc 1000]] The equally famous novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (not one to under rate the value of scientific proof) defended the women, claiming that determined ethereal forces suppressed their consciousnesses and transformed their bodies into the perfect medium of transmission. [[slnc 1000]] They became passive conduits for the desire of spirits to make themselves known in the modern world. Flesh and bone telegraph devices.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Other seekers for the truth of spirit presence, allowed that although the Fox sisters were frauds, other mediums might not be. Since some modern technologies offered potent evidence that spirits were real. [[slnc 1000]] Spirit photo­graphs, ranging widely in quality and sincerity, fed a booming demand for pictorial records of immaterial forces. [[slnc 1000]] Some employed almost laughably hokey stage effects, while others still have the power to haunt. [[slnc 1000]] The latter are poignant testaments of the desire to asswarge the pain of loss. [[slnc 1000]] The authenticity of spirit photographs sparked the 18 69 trial, of popular New York photographer William H. Mumler, one of the century’s most closely followed court battles. [[slnc 1000]] Mumler, perhaps best known for his image of devoted spiritualist believer Mary Todd Lincoln, comforted by an apparition of the dead President, was accused of defrauding his devoted fans and clients, passing off staged images as proof of genuine spiritual contact. [[slnc 1000]] In the highly publicized case, PT Barnum (noted expert on chicanery and gullibility) testified to the cravenness of Mumler’s devious deceits. [[slnc 1000]] Indeed, although the photographer was acquitted of fraud, photography’s ability to distort, blur, obscure, or lie, was revealed in the trial. Which shaped the course of its development as an aesthetic medium.

[[slnc 2000]] 

If photography offered one kind of scientific legitimation of spiritualism  (however spurious), and professional testing another, spiritual mediums  also called upon a third source of modern authority. They rarely acted alone. [[slnc 1000]] Giving their bodies over to contact with unseen entities, they customarily required an intermediary, in the form of a guide, operator, or control. a willing participant who possessed knowledge of the mind’s arcane powers. [[slnc 1000]] Hypnotists or mesmerists, often but not always profesho­nel “men of science,” produced deep passive trance states in their living subjects. [[slnc 1000]] Adherents believed complete suppression of the autonomous will, was necessary for the medium to function as a site of interchange. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Mesmerists claimed to manipulate the body’s animal magnetism. A term conjoining the vaporous intangibility of the annema, with the mysterious attractive and repulsive power of magnets. [[slnc 1000]] But when animated under the direction of a mesmerist, the ethers, vapors, energies, or electrical currents of the spirit-soul, drew inn, fluttered, circulated about the space of a room, and entered into the medium’s willing (if inert) corporeal body. [[slnc 1000]] This flesh, the “animal” part of humanity, was ultimately revealed by a transmitting medium to be little more than a sack of living meat, a sublunary conduit for the flow of what made humans truly human. The esoteric energies of a more celestial and eternal relm. [[slnc 1000]] Yet while the fluidic ether of spirits was profoundly strange (“real” but intangible unless clothed in the physical substance of the meediumz borrowed anatomy), it was also pure. [[slnc 1000]] Divested of bodily desires or demands, spirits were human souls, freed from any debasing urges. [[slnc 1000]] Like mathematical concepts or chemical formulae, these ethereal entities existed in a relm beyond mortality. And equally beyond variable changeable human morality. A consciousness beyond corruption or limits.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Mediums readily put their consciousness aside in the midst of forces flowing through them, enabling physical manifestation. [[slnc 1000]] Whether conceptualized as vaporous, or fluidic, or as currents of electricity, spiritual ether was amorphous but coalescent. Formless, yet amenable to any form, like paint, clay, or wax. An as yet inert and yielding artistic material. [[slnc 1000]] Within the vehicle of their living flesh, but activated by an alien agent, mediums behaved like puppets or dolls. Their limbs contorted, their faces changed. They grew tall or shrank, they spoke in foreign tongues and tones. [[slnc 1000]] To see, hear and feel these spine-tingling effects was the only conclusive proof that many observers (even likely skeptics) needed. [[slnc 1000]] Their own strong physical, sensory reactions were reminders that their bodies too were a mere medium for the soul. [[slnc 1000]] They would also someday find themselves released from the fleshy matter in which they were bound, freed to join the unfathomable.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Emerging as movement, sound, voices, or flickers of light, physical evidence of spiritual activation was facilitated by technological inventions such as lamps, spinning balls, Ouija boards, planchettes, or spiritual telephones. [[slnc 1000]] All of these devices nonetheless required the intermediary of a corporeal human body. [[slnc 1000]] Meediamistic practices embraced contradictions. They were both new and timeless, frightening yet comforting, public yet intimate. [[slnc 1000]] This newfound congress between living beings and the timeless, ideal and incorporeal spirit energies seemed to bridge other modern dualities. The chasm separating science from superstition, proof from speculation, and rationally grounded hope from irrational fantasy or wishful thinking. [[slnc 1000]] While contact with the spirits could never be proven beyond doubt by science, the physical embodiment mediums gave to forces exceeding the material terrestrial world’s confines, emerged as a compelling, secularized faith. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Though Modern Spiritualism was a new movement, it had precursors. [[slnc 1000]] Emmanuel Sweedenborg, 18th century Swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian and mystic, provided philosophical justifications for the reality of spirits. [[slnc 1000]] His doctrine of correspondences offered a way to reconcile modern contradiction, since he maintained that for every material entity, an incorporeal counterpart existed beyond temporal and spatial limits. [[slnc 1000]] The correspondence between the two (whether by resemblance or other analogical thinking), was the medium of exchange by which fundamental and eternal equivalence could be measured. [[slnc 1000]] His popular books and beliefs, established a market place of sorts, a site of perpetual exchange between immaterial and material states and conditions. Albeit one that he clothed in the language of faith. [[slnc 1000]] Later adherents of Sweedenborg, like Madame Helena Blavattsky, co-founder of the Theosophical Society, perpetuated his theologies. Making her mediumistic abilities an integral part of an entirely new faith.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Modern Spiritualism also strove to distinguish itself from primitive superstition, folklore, witch-craft, and even from traditional religion. [[slnc 1000]] Demonic possession (a preoccupation more endemic in prior centuries, now incompatible with 19th century scientific approaches to the soul), had been yet another way that the body had proven itself to be a flimsy, easily permeable vessel. [[slnc 1000]] In the more modern variation, a meediumz submission to spirits was like the unseen infiltration of disease; just as sickness could overtake bodies, so too could ethereal forces, either for good, or ill. [[slnc 1000]] Under scientific oversight, certain aspects of spiritual meediamship could be evaluated like any other reported physical condition. Yet mediums trans-acted their business in rationality’s shady hinterlands, where distinctions were murky.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Although the Fox sisters were discredited, and died in poverty after their reputation was ruined, the broader movement that took shape following their early performances continued. [[slnc 1000]] Modern Spiritualism was ecumenical, non-dogmatic, loosely Christian but not exclusively so, and its followers numbered in the millions by the end of the century. [[slnc 1000]] Particularly attractive to women, Spiritualism offered sanctioned opportunities to demonstrate agency as spiritual leaders, orators, and healers. [[slnc 1000]] Born in 1840 with a call on her face (a sign of her special gifts) Cora Lodencia Veronica Scott Hatch Tappan Richmond, became one of the most popular 19th century Spiritualists and mediums. [[slnc 1000]] Exceptionally well red and articulate, she toured the United States throughout the latter half of the 19th century, operated by a sequence of husbands, who mesmerized her to produce the passive state favorable for the transmission of directives from the magnetic, electric, fluidic ether. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

According to celebratory stories published in the Spiritualist journal, “The Banner of Light,” she channeled magnificent powers. [[slnc 1000]] Directed by the assistance of a dead German physician, she performed complicated surgeries before amazed audiences. [[slnc 1000]] In her lecture-performances, she discoursed at length from within the depths of her trances, on topics suggested at random by the audienc. [[slnc 1000]] Esoteric philosophies, scientific principles and discoveries, and arcane points of historical detail. Things presumably only spirits, or extremely well-educated professionals could possibly know. [[slnc 1000]] She clothed the impressive intellectual content of her performances in dramatic process. [[slnc 1000]] In her mesmerized state she showed a deft capacity to move between different emotional and physical conditions. [[slnc 1000]] Her petite pretty form, underwent dynamic transition. From charming conscious presence, to strange vibrations and superhuman contortions, and then back to serenity, poise. [[slnc 1000]] Her entranced mind within its medium-sized body became a potent site of exchange between differential states, as well as conventional gendered expectations. An embodied mediation of social change.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Thus Cora L. V. S. H. T. Richmond was an outspoken advocate of Spirit­ulism, insisting on meediamship’s scientific credibility. [[slnc 1000]] In 18 99, recognizing vital parallels with emerging branches of the science of the mind, she urged any and all curious seekers to take the phenomenal demonstrations of Universal Intelligence seriously as a modern project. The combined “mental and spiritual powers of mankind ... opens up a new relm, even to the ordinary student of psychology” (she asserted). [[slnc 1000]] Furthermore, just as material science has proved the indestructibility of the atom (she wrote), “Spiritualism proves the immortality of the individual soul by bases, deductions and proofs as undeniable as the principles of mathematics.”

[[slnc 2000]] 

As a new science, psychology itself occupied intermedial space, situated between philosophy and neurological physiology. [[slnc 1000]] Camillo Golgee (and Santiago Ramon ee Cayal) shared a 1906 Nobel prize for their work examining the intricate web of nerves and neurons, demonstrating that the physical body (an integrated sensory network), was an or-ganick machine. [[slnc 1000]] Their research pointed the way towards realization of the wholesale integration of consciousness and flesh. [[slnc 1000]] But if they showed ever more convincingly, that the mind was mobilized by impulses and sensations, arising from the distri­buted sensorium, other studies of the mind undermined such certainty. [[slnc 1000]] The mind’s greatest mysteries (revealed through phenomena like dreams, hallucinations, delusions, prophecies, automatic writing, telepathy and mesmerism) suggested that the body, however ingenious its nervous configuration, was merely a fragile, fallible and ultimately temporary receptacle. [[slnc 1000]] It was a medium through which more durable (if evanescent) energies passed. [[slnc 1000]] Spirit mediums expressly tested, and often rejected, the integrity of the mind body connection. [[slnc 1000]] Using psychological terminology newly familiar to readers, Richmond claimed, “the conscious spirit (the ego) inheres in the soul, and is not ... the result of contact with the human organism.”

[[slnc 2000]] 

To psychologist William James, the dynamic consciousness of the spirit-soul was beautiful even in its formlessness, challenging the imposition of any hard limits to his science. [[slnc 1000]] James’s 18 90 essay for Scribner’s Magazine, “The Hidden Self,” published the same year as his authoritative, two volume “Principles of Psychology,” introduced a broad cross-section of American readers to his expanding intrest in the immaterial aspects of the psyche, and the deep well of the unconscious mind. [[slnc 1000]] According to some, James put his reputation for scientific rigour on the line, but he regarded serious investigation of meediamistic phenomena as a necessary corollary to any investigation of sensation, perception, emotion, memory and physiology. [[slnc 1000]] Leading the American Society for Psychic Research, he investigated reports of supernatural phenomena. And his own studies probed the expansive capabilities of the normal mind, as well as its exceptional mental states.

[[slnc 2000]] 

James, along with fellow psychologists including G. Stanley Hall, observed and meticulously tested Mrs. Leonora Piper (a renowned and prosperous Boston clairvoyant and medium) over the span of 20 years. [[slnc 1000]] Impressed by Mrs. Pyper’s charismatic ability to inspire sincere belief by her facility for spiritual transactions, James evaluated the mind’s affective powers alongside its most elusive mystical capacities. [[slnc 1000]] Defending faith itself in his 18 96 essay, “The Will to Believe,” he wrote that both spiritualist followers and mediums possessed “a type of mind that takes hold of a range of truths to which the other kind is stone blind.” [[slnc 1000]] And towards the end of his life, after years of considered careful thought, James concluded that true mediums possessed rare but authentic capabilities to commune with forces beyond quotidian experience. [[slnc 1000]] In his 1909 essay “Confidences of a Psychical Researcher,” he confirmed that, “those who have the fullest acquaintance of the phenomena, admit that in good mediums there is a rizidyuum of knowledge displayed that can only be called super-normal. [[slnc 1000]] The medium taps into some source of information not open to ordinary people.” 

[[slnc 2000]] 


James reassured his readers that scientific skepticism was wise, even as he endorsed meediamistic powers of mind, thus helping forge a construct of unconscious that bridged models of a spiritually and psychologically defined self. [[slnc 1000]] He granted the possibility that ghosts might inhabit the embodied machine. [[slnc 1000]] Though some might be skeptical of the methods, ambitions, and sincerity of spiritual mediums today, they provided devoted followers with hope and comfort in the face of tremendous social change. [[slnc 1000]] While a few of James’s peers were dismayed by inadequate boundaries between the proper sphere of psychological science and informed speculation about mediums, the separation between these spheres wouldn’t widen significantly until the second decades of the 20th century. [[slnc 2000]] Before then, to be a medium meant to embrace contradictions, to willingly put oneself in the thick of things. At the very heart of the economic, aesthetic, cultural and epistemological transformations altering the fabric of American society.
