Ah Ha

[[slnc 2000]] 

What might this be? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

The question sounds simple enough, if perhaps a little menacing. With a cold stare passing through an otherwise innocent picture of twin butlers fighting over who will knot the master???s bow tie.[[slnc 1000]] Is it might that throws things off? Coaxing us to the outer limits of the plausible? [[slnc 2000]] What MIGHT this be? [[slnc 1000]] It might be spilled soup. It might be the shiny head and front pinch??ers of a beetle. It might be the savage dispassion of a clinicians stare. [[slnc 1000]] Or it might even be twin butlers.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Why do they fight? [[slnc 1000]] 
For the honor of tying the master???s bow tie. [[slnc 1000]] 
Who is their master? [[slnc 1000]] 
He???s not pictured. [[slnc 1000]] 
But his bow tie is? [[slnc 1000]] 
Correct. [[slnc 1000]] 
Might he be a ghost? [[slnc 1000]] 
He MIGHT be. [[slnc 1000]] 
Or an absentee landlord? [[slnc 1000]] 
Or the impersonal power of capital, the master we all serve. [[slnc 1000]] 
And this impersonal power wears a bow tie? [[slnc 1000]] 
The bow tie is personal. [[slnc 1000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

What might this BE? [[slnc 1000]] It???s a hopeful question. [[slnc 1000]] Whatever this is now, it might someday be something better, truer to itself. [[slnc 1000]] We all might be wonderful if only we will work hard and learn to be happy. [[slnc 1000]] If now it???s a mere inkblot, someday it might be an expensive work of art by Andy Warhol. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

What might this be? [[slnc 1000]] That???s the question for us. [[slnc 1000]] A question about things. Ten of them actually. Five black, two black and red, and one each of three, four and eight colors.???All printed on white or pale colored eighteen???by twenty four centimeter cards. [[slnc 1000]] This is the test that Hermann Raw Shock introduced in nineteen 21. [[slnc 1000]] In Psychodiagnostik, the accompanying book, the 37 year old psychiatrist presented the findings, for what he explained was an experiment still in its early stages. Conducted at that point, on 405 subjects at an Alpine hospital. Ranging from Normal, educated, to Arteriosclerotic dementz. [[slnc 1000]] He described the procedures for administering and scoring the test, and offered some observations on the workings of human perception. [[slnc 1000]] You look out at the world, and you leave the door open a crack. [[slnc 1000]] To perceive is to divulge a flash of psyche. [[slnc 1000]] For this reason, they would come to call the Raw Shock, a projective test, though the term does not appear in Psychodiagnostik. [[slnc 1000]] It was Lawrence K Frank, in nineteen 39. He said the test was like an X ray of the unconscious. [[slnc 1000]] ???We may approach the personality and induce the individual to reveal his way of organizing experience. His way of seeing life, his meanings, sig nifficnses, patterns. And especially his feelings.??? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

But such a vision of a supine unconscious, uncovered by inkblots, doesn???t quite accord with Raw Shock???s interest in a kind of perception animated by an interacting conscious and unconscious, past and present. [[slnc 1000]] Actually it wasn???t (strictly speaking) his. [[slnc 1000]] He borrowed a good deal from his mentor, Eugen Blewler, the Swiss psychiatrist who coined the term ambivalence. [[slnc 1000]] Here???s Blewler, as quoted by Raw Shock: 

[[slnc 1000]] 

Perceptions arise from the fact that sensations, or groups of sensations, ekphorize, meaning rouse from latency. Memory pictures of former groups of sensations within us. [[slnc 1000]] This produces in us a complex of memories of sensations, the elements of which, by virtue of their simultaneous occurrence in former experiences, have a particularly fine coherence, and are differentiated from other groups of sensations. [[slnc 1000]] In perception, therefore, we have three processes. Sensation, memory, and association. [[slnc 1000]] This identification of a homogeneous group of sensations, with previously acquired analogous complexes, together with all their connections, we designate as: apperception.

[[slnc 1000]] 

To perceive is to remember. [[slnc 1000]] To abstract what is being seen or experienced, and transpose it against a composite of earlier abstractions.[[slnc 1000]]  Raw Shock called these complexes of stored-up sensory experience, engrams, or memory pictures. [[slnc 1000]] Naturally, new sensations and old engrams need not be perfectly identical. Instead, each new perception adds another mark to the memory picture???s ever thickening impasto. [[slnc 1000]] If in the everyday, we assimilate new sensory experiences more or less unconsciously, Raw Shock wanted to find the, threshold beyond which perception becomes interpre??tation.???Elevated perception. ACTIVE perception. [[slnc 1000]] Hence the blots. The interpretation of chance forms can be called a perception, in which the effort of integration is so great, that it is realized consciously as an effort.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Though not spelled out as such by Raw Shock, the conditions for crossing that threshold between perception and interpretation include, firstly, a formal enclosure from normal life. [[slnc 1000]] It???s not the inkblot per se, but the context of its presentation. The abnormality of the task. The cards, one after the other. [[slnc 1000]] What might this be? [[slnc 1000]] And what might this be? [[slnc 1000]] It???s the same, we know, with a museum or a picture frame. [[slnc 1000]] They too, signal borders between the merely perceptible and the actively interpretable. [[slnc 1000]] Here is a thing apart, abstracted from life. [[slnc 1000]] The second, perhaps obvious condition of interpretation is articulation. [[slnc 1000]] Perception will be elevated only when you stop to say what the thing is. [[slnc 1000]] Interpretation is necessarily a linguistic act. [[slnc 1000]] If perception entails passively reconciling the new with what has come before, interpretation redirects the process, consciously casting the abstraction of the engram onto the present particularity of the novel stimulus. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

While the Raw Shock Blewler account of human perception may not enjoy wide acceptance among today???s cognitive scientists or neurologists, it still persuades as a means of modeling the fraught convergence of these three elements. [[slnc 1000]] Pictures, language, the past. [[slnc 1000]] The blots mark not only the story of the development and application of a very strange psychodiagnostic tool, but also of the equally inky territory around the habits, of looking at and talking about art. [[slnc 1000]] Because 1. If memory is a picture and language the means of interpretation, it is by the translation of picture into words that memory actively contains the new. [[slnc 1000]] And 2. Not all memories are personal. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Nor am I alone in catching historical memory at work here. [[slnc 1000]] Blewler adopted the notion of the engram from biologist Richard Seemon, who, in his nineteen 04 book Die Muneme, offered in place of Darwinian heredity a notion of organic memory, preserved and transmitted through living matter. [[slnc 1000]] Semon???s ideas were operative as well in the Munemosyne Atlas,???that ghost story for adults, to which Abby Warburg devoted the final years of his life, mapping the symbolic pathways and cultural memory traces that constituted, the afterlife of antiquity. [[slnc 1000]] Blewler???s trio of processes (sensation, memory, association)???adapted by Raw Shock for conscious effort as, sensation, memory, interpretation, might be further adjusted for our purposes as, vision, history, language. [[slnc 1000]] The past as mediator between subject and object. 

[[slnc 2000]] 
 
How do things remember? [[slnc 1000]] How does history assert itself, as one tries to interpret a picture, a thing, a blot of any kind? [[slnc 1000]] While historical memory can project onto objects in many different ways, we???d do well to look at a few. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Haunting

[[slnc 2000]] 

You don???t know it, but the picture you???re looking at, has been dead a hundred years. [[slnc 1000]] Warburg???s ghost story for adults calls for continual retelling.???[[slnc 1000]] All eras have their after lyves. [[slnc 1000]] And sometimes they haunt the margins of subsequent social and cultural patterns, whispering in the ears of objects and those who interpret them. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

An example of this is found in the prehistory of psychiatry, along a line of succession extending from Fraunz Mesmer, who could conduct the body???s magnetic fluids through gesture, touch, music and eye contact. Provoking fits, in order to cure physical or mental ailments, in the salons of Vienna and Paris in the 1770s and 80s. Down to the founders of the science of the self. [[slnc 1000]] Between these, more than a century of magnetists, mesmerists and spiritualists experimented with states of somnambulant lucidity, sayance and mind control. Out of which emerged a conception of the human mind, bi-furcated into conscious and unconscious. [[slnc 1000]] The Markee de Puysaygur, induced magnetic sleep in Paris in the early years of the nineteenth century. [[slnc 1000]] In 1823, Alexandre Bertrand published his Traitay du somnambooleesmuh A day differentte modificashee ons kill prayzant. [[slnc 1000]] Among German Romantics, magnetic states were explored with an eye to communing with the World Soul. [[slnc 1000]] In 1841, Scottish surgeon James Braid ree dubbed magnetism, hypnotism. And it was of course, under that name that it came to be used in psycho therapeutic practice. [[slnc 1000]] Charko, for example. [[slnc 1000]] While he probed the abysses of the human mind behind the walls of the Sal pet tree air, rumors titillated Paris of great hypnotic balls and strange things happening to the hysterical young women under his control. Though no such reports came back from his well known students, Janay, Froyd, Adler, Yung, and Blewler. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

The magic show of mesmerism was smuggled into the science of psychiatry. [[slnc 1000]] And even if hypnosis has long been banished from mainstream, post psycho analytic American clinical psychology, we can still catch sight of a magnetic past which continues to haunt some of the prized objects of psychotherapy, in its current positivist behaviorist mode. Namely in the Raw Shock inkblot. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Not much is known about the life of Raw Shock. [[slnc 1000]] Born in Zurich in 1897, raised in Schuff house in, the oldest of three. He studied medicine in New in burg, Zurich, and Burn, completing his training in Berlin in nineteen 10, where Blewler directed his thesis on hallucinations. [[slnc 1000]] Professional stints at several asighlums and sanatoria followed. Before an appointment as assistant director of the asighlums in Here is ow in nineteen 15, a position he held until his death in nineteen 22, at age 37. [[slnc 1000]] The writer Robert Walser, arriving a decade later, would spend more than 20 years there. [[slnc 1000]] Historian Henri Ellenberger insists that the source of Raw Shock???s experiment, was Justinus Kerner???s Kleck so graph ien, an 18 57 volume of occult poetry and little inkblot monsters, creatures of chance. [[slnc 1000]] Kerner was a physician, poet, and leading German magnetist of the mid 1800s. [[slnc 1000]] His book helped popularize the spiritualist parlor game of reading inkblots to communicate with ghosts, and remained in print until the end of the century.??[[slnc 1000]] According to some accounts, decades after Kerner???s death, young Raw Shock was so taken with the inkblot parlor game, that the children of Schuff house in nicknamed him Klex, from Klecksen, meaning ???to blot.??? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

The perception of a monster or a ghost by a subject, should be scored as a negative response. [[slnc 1000]] It may indicate repressed frustration, anger or aggression. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Fetish

[[slnc 2000]] 

Here???s the procedure laid out in Psychodiagnostik.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The subject is given one plate after the other and asked, ???What might this be???? [[slnc 1000]] He holds the plate in his hand and may turn it about as much as he likes. [[slnc 1000]] The subject is free to hold the plate near his eyes, or far away, as he chooses. However, it should not be viewed from a distance. [[slnc 1000]] The length of the extended arm is the maximum permissible distance.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In scoring the test, the content of interpretations, for Raw Shock, was the least important of four factors, including number of responses, concentration on details versus the entire blot. And (most important of all) the relative attention paid by the subject to form, color and movement. [[slnc 1000]] He laid out a method for scoring these responses. [[slnc 1000]] For example, a subject who saw two carnival clowns in Plate 2 was scored W M plus H, meaning: Whole blot, Movement, plus Human figure. [[slnc 1000]] A response of modernistic butterfly tie, to Plate 3, was scored: D F C plus o b j. A normal Detail, determined primarily by Form, and only secondarily by Color. Plus interpretation of an inanimate object. [[slnc 1000]] The answers to all ten would be added up. The final results offering an assessment of personality type, or pathology. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Not insignificant changes have occurred since Raw Shock???s day in the implementation and scoring of the test. [[slnc 1000]] The subject now responds to the cards twice. The first time in what is called the Association Phase. And then again in an Inquiry phase, where the examiner asks the subject to explain where and how she or he saw, what she or he saw. [[slnc 1000]] Scoring encompasses additional factors like shading and blending. Vast new content categories and a greater emphasis on content. Something called form-level, or how reasonable an interpretation is for a given form. And the popularity of a given response.

[[slnc 2000]] 

This increasing complexity is the story of the Americanization of the Raw Shock. [[slnc 1000]] It came here early. [[slnc 1000]] David Levy, a young American psychiatrist studying in Switzerland, brought back a set of blots in nineteen 21. [[slnc 1000]] De votees were forthcoming. [[slnc 1000]] ???The mainstream of academic psychology looked askance at the Raw Shock movement,??? according to one study of the reception of the Swiss import. ???Criticizing its cultist character and lack of scientific discipline.??? [[slnc 1000]] World War 2 brought with it a sudden demand for psychodiagnostic tools, and that was the foot in the door. [[slnc 1000]] By the nineteen 60s there was fierce competition between competing schools of Raw Shockers, mainly overcome with the advent, in nineteen 74, of John Exner???s Comprehensive System. Which standardized the test into an elaborate scheme of psychometrics. [[slnc 1000]] Meanwhile, Raw Shock indices of various diseases have been correlated to the checklists of symptoms laid down in the DSM.

[[slnc 2000]]  

With all this innovation, it???s perhaps unsurprising that Psychodiagnostik has long been out of print. [[slnc 1000]] By contrast, the blots remain unchanged. [[slnc 1000]] They are the exact same ten accidental forms. [[slnc 1000]] This makes them not only among the most persistent of images, but also perhaps the most interpreted. [[slnc 1000]] Millions of people over the past century, have cast eyes on precisely the same inkblots, and had their say as to what they might be. [[slnc 1000]] And while to the irritation of Raw shockers, reproductions of the blots can be found online, the printing of the cards remains the closely guarded intellectual property of Raw Shock???s original Burn publisher, Verlag Hans Huber. [[slnc 1000]] To ensure consistency, the cards,???incredibly,???are printed on the very same presses that produced the first run. [[slnc 1000]] This complete fidelity to the preliminary, indeed arbitrary, instruments of a young provincial Swiss psychiatrist, the certainty that they have not and cannot change,???such is the stronghold of the Raw Shock fetish. [[slnc 1000]] The cards assume a kind of preciousness. They must be kept in a state of purity, guarded as one would an heirloom or a talisman. [[slnc 1000]] The cards! [[slnc 1000]] We speak of them as the acolytes of the tarot speak of theirs. In the hushed voice of ancient wisdom. [[slnc 1000]] Only with this deck, we???ll read your past rather than your future. [[slnc 1000]] However complex the interpretive and psychometric apparatus grows, we are reassured that these humble objects possess a perfect persistence. In an unbroken chain of testing back to the hysterics and morons in Here is ow. [[slnc 1000]] Fetishized by the Raw Shockers, the cards are, in turn, made a fetish for the subjects, who are told to see these objects as possessing qualities beyond the concrete. [[slnc 1000]] Invest them with meaning. Project onto them memory pictures. The blots forget nothing. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Accretion

[[slnc 2000]] 

They soak it all up. [[slnc 1000]] Just look at the vast records of answers, tables of response ratios and clusters, and test transcriptions. The unwieldy published indices of Raw Shock responses, 1000 page volumes with tens of thousands of answers, catalogued according to several variables. Which have, for many Raw Shockers, finally given way to the automation of assessment software. [[slnc 1000]] All of this is why the Raw Shock works. [[slnc 1000]] There???s just so much of it. [[slnc 1000]] Every test is both an affirmation of,???and contribution to,???that which has come before. [[slnc 1000]] The Raw Shock lives by accretion. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Many psychologists see it as a baseless bit of hocus pocus, lacking in validity and reliability. It???s not at all unlikely that two examiners will get different results out of the same subject. [[slnc 1000]] These critics look in befuddlement and frustration upon the persistence of the test, and the blind devotion of its practitioners. [[slnc 1000]] Raw Shockers will not be cowed. [[slnc 1000]] As a case in point, consider this fragment of dialog from the Handbook of Forensic Raw Shock Assessment, a model interaction for the expert witness Raw shocker questioned in a cross examination.  

[[slnc 500]] 

Attorney:

[[slnc 500]]

Using the Raw Shock is pretty controversial, isn???t it Doctor?

[[slnc 500]]

Witness:

[[slnc 500]]

Although there are some people who criticize use of the Raw Shock, just as there are some critics of almost every procedure used in delivering health care services, the Raw Shock is very widely used and taught. And the evidence supporting its use for appropriate purposes is very strong.

[[slnc 500]]  

Attorney:

[[slnc 500]]

As I understand it, the Buros Mental Measurement Yearbook is a highly regarded reference source. And Arthur Jensen is a distinguished psycholo??gist. And what he had to say about the inkblot test in that yearbook was, and I quote, ???The rate of scientific progress in clinical psychology, might well be measured by the speed and thoroughness with which it gets over the Raw Shock.??? [[slnc 1000]] So how can you come into this courtroom and ask us to base an important decision, even in small part, on a discredited test?

[[slnc 500]]

Witness:

[[slnc 500]]

With all due respect to Dr.???Jensen, he said that back in nineteen 65. And he was wrong then, because there has been a lot of scientific progress in clinical psychology over the last 40 years. And during that same time, the number of Raw Shock tests being given around the world has increased substantially. [[slnc 1000]] And if Jensen were to say the same thing now, he would be wrong again.

[[slnc 2000]] 

How can it be wrong when it keeps going on? Can???t stop, won???t stop.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The force of accretion is not the same as the force of tradition, whose authority is rooted in the past, at some originary moment. [[slnc 1000]] Nor is it the force of habit, which makes no claim at all to authority. [[slnc 1000]] The Raw Shock by contrast, is right because we have amassed so many results. Because it has gone on and because it carries on. [[slnc 1000]] It is justified by amassment, by forward movement. [[slnc 1000]] By no means nostalgic, the logic of accretion regards the past, only insofar as it is here congealed in the present. [[slnc 1000]] It glances back to frame an active process, and demands to be spoken of in the present perfect continuous. [[slnc 1000]] We have been Raw Shocking. 

[[slnc 2000]] 


Accretion

[[slnc 2000]] 

And isn???t it the same with painting? Against the claims of exhaustion or historical irrelevance that one used to hear, painting too carries on.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Interviewing Andy Warhol in nineteen 85, Benjamin Buooklow pressed the artist about his Raw Shock series. [[slnc 1000]] As always, Warhol played the ny eef. [[slnc 1000]] Buooklow offered a reading of the Raw Shocks and the earlier Oxidation paintings as a sendup of Neo Expressionism,???of the gesture reborn. ???The general return to painterly expressivity and technique.??? [[slnc 1000]] Warhol: ???Oh, I like all paintings. it???s just amazing that it keeps, you know, going on.??? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

And on into our own moment, in which painting remains, in the words of Roberta Smith writing in the New???York???Times in 2010, ???very lively,??? our markets just ravenous for the stuff. [[slnc 1000]] If those obituaries, then, were premature, they still form the backdrop against which we watch painting persevere. [[slnc 1000]] Smith: ???Few modern myths about art have been as persistent or as annoying as the so-called death of painting.??? [[slnc 1000]] Thus she launches her state of the medium. [[slnc 1000]] I will celebrate the vitality of painting today, but first let me assure you that it is not dead. [[slnc 1000]] What???s dead is not very lively,???and vice versa. [[slnc 1000]] The question therefore, is not why isn???t painting dead? [[slnc 1000]] But rather, how does it stay so lively? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Smith tells us that many people are making fine paintings,e and that they are unburdened by any sense of restriction or rules. [[slnc 1000]] ???They feel freer to paint what they want than at any time since the nineteen 30s, or maybe even the 1890s.??? [[slnc 1000]] So, it???s a feeling. A feeling that was lost, evidently, in the 20th century. A feeling of freedom. From grand narratives? [[slnc 1000]] Formal conventions? [[slnc 1000]] The obligation to innovate? [[slnc 1000]] The delusion of novelty? [[slnc 1000]] The myth of progress? [[slnc 1000]] Historical agency? [[slnc 1000]] eSmith delineates some of the current tendencies in painting. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Freaky Figuration. [[slnc 1000]] Egged on by various amalgams of psychedelic and outsider art, Surrealism and Neo Expressionism,???not to mention Philip Guston, Dana Schutz, Martin Kippenberger and Thomas Trosch and Katherine Bernhardt,???many painters are veering from the hallucinatory to the ny eve and back again.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Then there???s Early Modernism Reducks. [[slnc 1000]] With George Condo and Sean Landers among the precedents, some artists are revisiting European painting of the late nineteenth and early 20th centuries, But less in the spirit of ironic slumming, ?? la the nineteen 80s, and more in search of new. Style reviving vitality and saturated color, sometimes mixed with hints of late 20th century cartooning, and attention to saturated color.

[[slnc 2000]] 

And her thumbnail descriptions of some of the most exciting young painters. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Christoph Ruckhuberle, looks back to early Miro through the lens of Balthus. Nina Chanel Abney rephrases some of the starchy simplicity of Marie Laurencin, by way of South Park.

[[slnc 2000]] 

No question about it. Looking back and rephrasing can indeed be very lively. But painting differs from other dinners at the all you can eat post-historical buffet of simultaneous styles. [[slnc 1000]] When say, novelists or sculptors or filmmakers look back and rephrase, they do so typically with an eye to cleverness, naughtiness, nostalgia. [[slnc 1000]] Not so painters. [[slnc 1000]] Looking back and rephrasing is simply what painting now is. [[slnc 1000]] Every painting is a readymade, a memory picture. [[slnc 1000]] Notwithstanding the sometimes anxious rhetoric about revisiting???and revisiting earlier revisits,???of reconsidering, interrogating, or working through the legacies of this or that chapter from the history of the medium. Painting works for the same reason the Raw Shock does, because there???s been so much of it, because people have already made so many paintings. [[slnc 1000]] We have been painting. [[slnc 1000]] A field of vision that takes in both the horizon behind us and the ground on which we stand. [[slnc 1000]] It requires no justification, other than the continual process of the amassing of paint. [[slnc 1000]] Put otherwise, ???it keeps, you know, going on.??? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Fetish

[[slnc 2000]] 

After more than a decades hiatus, Warhol returned to painting. [[slnc 1000]] He had signaled his renunciation of the medium, in nineteen 65, with the release of a silver helium filled balloon from the roof of the Factory. And said he just wanted to, quote, do the movies.[[slnc 1000]] He inaugurated his return by pissing on canvases primed with metallic paint. [[slnc 1000]] The Oxidation Paintings, or Piss Paintings as they???re sometimes fondly known, mark the start of a period that has come to be seen as a rebirth for the artist, after a stretch of the nineteen 70s devoted principally to the growth of Warhol Enterprises, Interview magazine, Andy Warhol???s TV, and lots of portrait commissions. [[slnc 1000]] The Piss Paintings ???also open a sequence of abstract works. Which, though by no means predominant in that productive final decade, are the late Warhols that draw the most attention. [[slnc 1000]] Including Shadows, the Yarn Paintings, and our Raw Shock series, these were, apart from the color coordinated monochrome blanks of the nineteen 60s, the artist???s first abstract paintings. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Maybe there???s something tantalizing about the slayer of Abb Exx, toying catlike, with his lifeless prey. [[slnc 1000]] Or it could be the delight of watching a loss of composure. Pop???s cool giving way to impulse,???though that???s not exactly how Warhol???s fellow Raw shocker Jay Shriver remembered it.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Interview moved from 860 Broadway to a new building on 33rd Street in nineteen 84. [[slnc 1000]] By then, 860 was basically just an empty 14,000 square foot loft, left for Andy to paint in. [[slnc 1000]] That???s when the paintings get really huge. [[slnc 1000]] And nobody was there to bother him. That???s what enabled the Raw Shocks. [[slnc 1000]] Andy said, ???We need a new idea.??? [[slnc 1000]] And by that time, it had been made very clear to me that abstraction was an important element that he wanted to pursue, and abstractions weren???t being commissioned. [[slnc 1000]] So I thought of the Raw Shocks, because it was primitive printmaking.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Primitive printmaking. Back to basics. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol or Shriver would prepare half a canvas with a half-painted Raw Shock. [[slnc 1000]] Shriver.

[[slnc 2000]] 

We had these huge canvases that we had to fold over and press together so that the paint was evenly distributed on both halves of the canvas. [[slnc 1000]] We took some of the huge dowels, on which canvas was shipped, and Andy, Augusto Bugarin, Benjamin Loo and myself would get on our hands and knees, rolling the dowels and patting the canvas to get an even pressure across the entire surface.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Another question of fundamentals (something akin to asset fundamentals)???is suggested in Shreyevers account, with his emphasis on size and that line about abstractions not then, quote, ???being commissioned.??? [[slnc 1000]] Novelty is rarely commissioned,???not when one has such a familiar branded product in the first place. [[slnc 1000]] The great rhapsodist of American capitalism in its Golden Age woke up, a few years into the Long Downturn, to find he had adopted (to a large extent) the economic model of the artisan. [[slnc 1000]] As to the truism of bigger price tags for bigger art, we might recall Warhol???s claims about the purpose of his blanks from a nineteen 65 interview.[[slnc 1000]] ???You see, for every large painting I do, I paint a blank canvas, the same background color. The two are designed to hang together however the owner wants. [[slnc 1000]] It just makes them bigger and mainly makes them cost more.??? [[slnc 1000]] The statement should be taken with a grain of salt, of course, but Warhol had a knack for being at once flippant and dead serious. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

His work often hinged on the facts,???and mysteries,???of commodity valuation. Nowhere more so than in the Campbell???s cans, Coke bottles, and Brillo boxes. [[slnc 1000]] By repeatedly abstracting these products from supermarket shelves and projecting them (in simply aestheticized translation) onto the gilded screen of art, Warhol illustrated,???or just reproduced,???the capitalist mystifications of the commodity. [[slnc 1000]] We are in that world of fetishes that Marx spoke of, ???an enchanted, perverted, topsy turvy world, in which Monsieur le Capital and Madame la Terre do their ghost walking as social characters and, at the same time, directly as mere things.??? [[slnc 1000]] Our perception of social reality is mediated by all these things bought and sold,???including, of course, our own labor. [[slnc 1000]] From a bird???s eye view, buying and selling is simply what we do. [[slnc 1000]] And still these things appear to us not for how they fit in to,???and come out of,???a world of lives of buying and selling. But instead in the abstract form of value. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Warhol???s translation of consumer commodities into luxury commodities plays on these misperceptions. [[slnc 1000]] A Coke is a Coke, he wrote, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. [[slnc 1000]] All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. [[slnc 1000]] Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. [[slnc 1000]] It???s a classic Warhol formulation. A joke that leaves you to deliver the punch line. Never mind that Liz Taylor could buy more Cokes. She could also buy the Cokes unmentioned in Warhol???s democratic reverie. In other words, those that he painted, which of course are better than the others. [[slnc 1000]] Here???s Warhol the shrewd business artist, the more rarified the commodity, the simpler it is. The work of art, the supreme luxury commodity, is the simplest of all. [[slnc 1000]] It???s luxuriousness depends merely on the fact that neither you, nor the bum on the corner, can have it. The formulation is not, there are few rich people and art is expensive therefore only rich people have art. [[slnc 1000]] Instead: there are only a few rich people, therefore art is art.

[[slnc 2000]] 

It???s a sober account of the place of art under capitalism, unmuddied by the mystic convulsions of, say, Abstract Expressionism.[[slnc 1000]] What else would we expect? [[slnc 1000]] Good business is the best art, Warhol said. Hence, It just makes them bigger and mainly makes them cost more. [[slnc 1000]] But it only mainly makes them cost more. Room enough remains for them to do the other stuff we like. [[slnc 1000]] And it is in that remainder,???just past the profit margin, where the brute facts of commodification meet the impresitions of perceiving and talking about art. Where Warhol???s work most fully operates. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Haunting

[[slnc 2000]] 

Those supermarket staples again, they posed a pointed challenge to like or hate, to respond somehow, to interpret.???[[slnc 1000]] Yes, in the way that perhaps art is expected to do. [[slnc 1000]] But in their exuberant simplicity, deadpan renderings and repetitions, they seem to phrase the question with Raw Shock ian directness. [[slnc 1000]] What might this be? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Warhol was fascinated by the passions and conventions, of the language around art. [[slnc 1000]] Again and again, he seemed to delight in the possibility of provoking a conversation on which he could eavesdrop. [[slnc 1000]] That he so often did this through seemingly dumb or distant works of art, is echoed in the 
mannered and aloof Warhol persona, in the simplicities and elisions in his pronouncements. [[slnc 1000]] The reticent Warhol, his diaries consist of the transcriptions of brief phone conversations, whose purpose was to account for expenditures in the event of an audit. [[slnc 1000]] He purged himself of all but the idle ist of language, creating in the process a pointed silence. An echo chamber in which to amplify the comedy of interpretation. Those awkward responses to the great Raw Shock of Warhol???s personae, provocations, and art.

[[slnc 2000]]  

For instance, Keith Hartley has written, ???Throughout his career, Warhol seems to have revered the purity and raw energy of Abstract Expression??ism. And again and again he came up with strategies to allow him to compete with it.??? [[slnc 1000]] The Raw Shocks and other late abstractions, constitute both straight homage, and attempts at collapsing the heroics and sublime individualism, of Abstract Expressionist painting.

[[slnc 2000]] 

According to Joseph D. Ketner II,

[[slnc 1000]] 

Given that he matured during the hegemony of Abstract Expressionism, serious painting for Warhol meant abstraction. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s parody of Pollock and Color Field painting is obvious, but it could be argued that Warhol simultaneously demonstrated deference to his peers and predecessors, among the Abstract Expressionists and Color Field artists.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In the words of an anonymous author of lot notes for Christie???s New York Sale 2597, Postwar & Contemporary Art, Lot 57, November 14, 2012, Evening Sale, Raw Shock, price realized $2,770,500. 

[[slnc 500]] 

In a Warholian mechanization of Jackson Pollock???s drip dance, Warhol poured black paint in abstract compositions onto one half of an unrolled canvas that had been laid out over the studio floor.

[[slnc 2000]] 

And Rosalind Krauss? 

[[slnc 1000]] 

The optical webs of Jackson Pollock???s drip pictures became Warhol???s model and target in the mid nineteen 70s, part of his consistent, relentless, and articulate critique of the high art assumptions of his time. The notion that the body could be left behind in one or another version of transcendence. Spiritual, metaphysical, optical, [[slnc 1000]] The sloughing off of the temporal embeddedness of existence in the assumption of a spatiality that would speak of nothing but its own autonomous self evidence.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Were these the high art assumptions of nineteen 84? [[slnc 1000]] Are the Raw Shocks, always spoken of in the same breath as the Piss Paintings and the other late abstractions, really about American abstract painting from three decades before? [[slnc 1000]] That seems to be the consensus. The late abstractions are haunted by the style of painting dominant when Warhol was a commercial artist in his 20s. [[slnc 1000]] He was fixated on the Abstract Expression??ists,???either suddenly in the nineteen 70s, or consistently throughout his life. [[slnc 1000]] Hartley again. ???Put bluntly, he wanted on one level to like (and be liked by) Pollock and other macho artists. But because he was rejected by them, he adopted a contrary stance.??? [[slnc 1000]] Blunt indeed.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Yet this insistent chorus confirms that, whatever the differences, the Raw Shock test subject and the art critic share at least one procedure. [[slnc 1000]] It is articulated variously by the latter, but occurs among the former so frequently in a single formulation, that the phrase has earned an abbreviation in the standard Raw Shock shorthand. L L. [[slnc 500]] Looks like. [[slnc 500]] As in looks like spilled soup. [[slnc 500]] Looks like a Pollock. [[slnc 500]] Looks like a memory picture.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Warhol???s own explanation of the abstract dimension of these works centered not on fixation but misunderstanding. [[slnc 1000]] I thought that when you went to places like hospitals, they tell you to draw and make the Raw Shock Tests. I wish I???d known there was a set. [[slnc 1000]] Again, a grain of salt. [[slnc 1000]] And again, it???s a great comment that???true or not,???says a lot more than it lets on. [[slnc 1000]] As implausible as it sounds,???that over the course of the year that Warhol and his studio hands worked on these, folding over 14 foot long canvases, no one ever realized that there existed a set that might be easily silkscreened. The story gave Warhol cover to produce some of his only works that did not incorporate pre existing images, and play with the vagaries of looking like. [[slnc 1000]] The paintings resemble a Raw Shock inkblot just enough, and dissolve into ornate filigreed patterning. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

???I thought that when you went to places like hospitals, they tell you to draw and make the Raw Shock Tests.??? [[slnc 1000]] Places like hospitals. 

[[slnc 1000]] 

Museums? 

[[slnc 500]] 

Yes. 

[[slnc 500]] 

That???s where they???ll tell you what these drawings mean. [[slnc 1000]] And here???s Warhol from that interview with Buchloh. [[slnc 1000]] ???The Raw Shock is a good idea, and doing it just means I have to spend some time writing down what I see in the Raw Shock. That would make it more interesting, if I could write down everything I read.??? [[slnc 1000]] Everything he read! [[slnc 1000]] Pat Hackett commented that Warhol frequently had a pen in his hand,???though he only ever wrote his own name, signing checks and autographs. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

A year later, speaking with Robert Nickas, Warhol echoed and elaborated. 

[[slnc 1000]] 
 
I was trying to do these, to actually read into them and write about them. But I never really had the time to do that. [[slnc 1000]] So I was going to hire somebody to read into them, to pretend it was me. So that they???d be a little more interesting. [[slnc 1000]] But because all I would see would be a dog???s face, or something like a tree or a bird or a flower. [[slnc 1000]] Somebody else could see a lot more. But maybe they shouldn???t have any reading into them at all. [[slnc 1000]] None at all.

[[slnc 2000]] 

There???s that silence again. [[slnc 1000]] The Raw Shocks are not so much satires of, or straight homage to, Abstract Expres??sionism as they are to criticism, to talking about art. [[slnc 1000]] And therefore we???ll let Warhol, who was actually really good at talking about art, have the last word.

[[slnc 2000]] 
 
Nothing can always be the subject of something. [[slnc 1000]] I mean, what???s nice about those paintings is you could do them every five years,???anytime you wanted to, when you had the time. Because there???s nothing to read into them. [[slnc 1000]]???Because even if the paints stayed the same, everything else,???and everyone else,???would have changed.
