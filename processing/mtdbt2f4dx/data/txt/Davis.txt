ART WORLD MEDIUM

[[slnc 2000]]

To butcher Charles Dickens, it is the best of times and the worst of times for contemporary art. [[slnc 1000]] On the one hand, there has never been so much contemporary art, and in so many styles. [[slnc 1000]] The post medium condition, the idea that contemporary art imposes no specific limits on what it can tolerate,???is taken as a glorious given. [[slnc 1000]] We live in a golden age of artistic pluralism.

[[slnc 2000]]

On the other hand, we also live in a golden age of artistic angst. [[slnc 1000]] Every??where, you hear people talking about how the serious and soulful side of art is being taken over by new money, shallow celebrity, and rapaicious marketers. [[slnc 1000]] The globalized fair and biennial circuit appears as a mono??culture of prepackaged art brands. [[slnc 1000]] The same small tribe of curators, critics, and creators circle the earth endlessly. 

[[slnc 2000]]

My thesis is that these two seemingly disconnected themes are actually halves of a whole. [[slnc 1000]] To understand how this might be the case, it???s worth digging into a term that is casually invoked in both discussions but that goes undefined, the ???art world.??? [[slnc 1000]] The idea I want to explore is this. The actual medium of contemporary art is the art world itself. And that this fact accounts for both contemporary art???s diversity and its homogeneity. 

[[slnc 2000]]

There has not always been an art world.???In the United States, its existence as a given dates from the late nineteen 50s and early nineteen 60s, when artist became an identity integrated into mainstream life via the media presence of the Abstract Expressionists, the growth of an art market, government recognition of the arts, and mainstream press coverage. [[slnc 1000]] That doesn???t mean that there weren???t working artists before this period, but they didn???t have something like an established world to relate to. [[slnc 1000]] An art world can be distinguished from an art scene. [[slnc 1000]] Writing of the pre-war period of American art, Doray Ashton explained its relative isolation. [[slnc 1000]] 

Even in the twenties, the little towns throughout America usually had at least one piano teacher and often a circle of literary ladies subscribing to newly organized book clubs, but art was taught very rarely in the local high school, and if there were art classes, they were horribly debased. [[slnc 1000]] Mechanical drawing, even in the universities, was the nearest approach to art, and it was taught for obvious utilitarian reasons. [[slnc 1000]] These extreme conditions sent the determinedly artistic youth fleeing to the few large cities in America, where there were usually a few art schools, and some pretension to visual culture.

[[slnc 2000]]

Within artistic bohemia, painters and sculptors constituted a subset of the bohemian literary set, of the literary and musical bohemia of Grinitch Village. And a fairly inconsequential one at that. [[slnc 1000]] Painters were still, more or less, viewed by society at large as trades people. [[slnc 1000]] Those who committed themselves to painting, generally saw it as a calling, motivated by a strong sense of their craft???s deep spiritual meaning. 

[[slnc 2000]]

It is against the background of a transition away from this isolation that you have to read Arthur Dantoh???s seminal nineteen 64 essay The Art world, which gets credit for giving the idea of an art world its modern use. [[slnc 1000]] The Abstract Expressionists??? achievement was to elevate painting, in the US context, above its traditional givens as a craft. [[slnc 1000]] Splashes of paint on canvas weren???t depictions of the world, but they weren???t just splashes of paint either.???[[slnc 1000]] They were the expression of a world view. [[slnc 1000]] In the process, these artists established a place in society for the artist as someone who created intellectual and spiritual value, as well as painted images. And Dantoh sees Andy Warhol???s Brillo Boxes, as taking this new status of the artist to its ironic conclusion. 

[[slnc 2000]]

Dantoh would tease out the implications of this observation for the rest of his very long career. [[slnc 1000]] The argument in The Art world  is the early form of his most famous assertion. That we had reached the end of art, by which he meant exactly that we had entered an age of pluralism. [[slnc 1000]] It does not matter any longer what you do, which is what pluralism means. [[slnc 1000]] When one direction is as good as another direction, there is no concept of direction any longer to apply. [[slnc 1000]] The spiritually subjective character of Abstract Expressionism, logically led, Danto thought, to total artistic pluralism. Where it was impossible to agree on a single definition of capital Ay Art. [[slnc 1000]] What makes this earlier essay worth revisiting however, is that it reminds us of the fact that the same text that introduces the theme of the end of art also creates the idea of an  art world. The two ideas presuppose one another.

[[slnc 2000]]

What in the end makes the difference between a Brillo box, and a work of art consisting of a Brillo box, is a certain theory of art. [[slnc 1000]] It is the theory that takes it up into the world of art, and keeps it from collapsing into the real object which it is. In a sense of is, other than that of artistic identification. [[slnc 1000]] Of course, without the theory, one is unlikely to see it as art, and in order to see it as part of the art world, one must have mastered a good deal of artistic theory, as well as a considerable amount of the history of recent New York painting. [[slnc 1000]] It could not have been art fifty years ago. [[slnc 1000]] But then there could not have been (everything being equal), flight insurance in the Middle Ages, or Etruscan typewriter erasers. [[slnc 1000]] The world has to be ready for certain things. The art world no less than the real one.

[[slnc 2000]]

Or here???s the ess ay???s most famous line.

To see something as art requires something the eye cannot decry, an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art, an art world.

[[slnc 2000]]

The explicit corollary of the fact that anything can be art, is that it must enter into dialogue with a now self consciously defined body of ideas, within a newly self conscious art scene. [[slnc 1000]] The new pluralism, and the new professionalism, overlap.

[[slnc 2000]]

Contemporary art???s narrative about itself as a particularly liberated aesthetic space sometimes obscures this. [[slnc 1000]] As Anna Brzyski writes in a recent essay on Painter of Light Thomas Kin caid???s non relation with the traditional discourse of the art world, the lion???s share of writing about art today tends to ashume parameters of quality that it doesn???t actually admit or define. [[slnc 1000]] Critics actually focus obsessively on a very narrow slice of visual culture, excluding the vast majority of what is shown in the United States. 

The closer one gets to the here and now, the narrower the definition of art becomes, and the tighter the controls over the content of the category. [[slnc 1000]] For the last fifty years or so, a period belonging to living artists, the field of art has contracted to such an extent, that the typical relationship between the normative and the exceptional is, in effect, reversed. [[slnc 1000]] When contemporary art becomes the subject of discussion and study in art history, a very narrow and elite register of current practice becomes the norm that defines the entire field. [[slnc 1000]] It functions in that context as a designation and a value judgment.

[[slnc 2000]]

What then, determines the specific limits of the art world as a space? [[slnc 1000]] To put flesh on the theoretical environs of Dantoh???s artworld, it is worth bringing in a second classic essay on the subject. Critic and curator Lawrence Allaway???s nineteen 72 essay Network: The Art World Described as a System, written for the tenth anniversary of Artforum. [[slnc 1000]] Here???s Allaway. 

[[slnc 2000]]

What is the outpost of the art world viewed as a system? [[slnc 1000]] It is not art because that exists prior to distribution and without the technology of infor??mation. [[slnc 1000]] The output is the distribution of art, both literal and in mediated form as text and reproduction. [[slnc 1000]] The individual reasons for distribution vary. [[slnc 1000]] With dealers it can be assumed to be the profit motive at one remove. [[slnc 1000]] Art galleries, museums, universities, publishers, are all part of the nolijj industry, producing signifiers whose signified are works of art, artists, styles, periods.

[[slnc 2000]]

The possibility of self defining what art is, as Dantoh describes it, corre??sponds to this new importance of distribution, over the art object that Allaway traces. [[slnc 1000]] Concretely, he writes about how the new period produced a new kind of writing, the artist statement and the interview as characteristic products of the moment. [[slnc 1000]] Therefore, the media circulation of the artist???s persona becomes part of the art experience in a new and more aggressive way. 

[[slnc 2000]]

How close or far away are we from these observations today? [[slnc 1000]] If Allaway writes ruefully that, The failure to interpret has left us with a backlog of unevaluated interviews, imagine how we stand in the present, with our greatly increased volume of circulating discourse! [[slnc 1000]] Writing recently, Pamela Emm???Lee questions whether Dantoh and Allaway???s definitions of the art world still hold under contemporary conditions. 

[[slnc 2000]]

Alloway???s theorization of the art world continues to authorize the language and secret handshakes that grant membership into a closed society. [[slnc 1000]] But what happens when the world itself is progressively aestheticized as global spectacle, a culture of design and the image, not to mention the capital investments, that everywhere seek a new audience for that images distribution? [[slnc 1000]] What happens if ours is now an open system, and Dantoh???s atmosphere compounded of artistic theories, has expanded beyond measure in a virtual Babel of new languages, histories, and ideas beyond the borders of the conventional art world? [[slnc 1000]] Is it still possible, ultimately, to separate Allaway???s negotiated environment from the environment which would seem to encompass it. Where the theories and protocols that were once the exclusive purview of the art world, take on the status of a new cultural and mental labor?

[[slnc 2000]]

Lee???s observations here are a variation on the sense of crisis that I began with. That art???s distinctness is being overrun by the new realities of commerce, P R, and global spectacle. [[slnc 1000]] It is indeed possible that art???s special staytus is eroding under the impact of a frenetic visual culture. [[slnc 1000]] But I also think she is flattening some of what is most interesting???and useful???about Allaway???s essay, and Dantoh???s before it. [[slnc 1000]] What is remark??uble about ???Network??? is that, in Allaway???s assessment, the art world comes into being only at the moment that the secret handshake culture of art breaks down. And the channels of media distribution are already taking on an importance over and above the art itself.

[[slnc 2000]]

Thus, Allaway describes, on the one hand, the increased presence and influence of a specialist universe of art magazine discourse. [[slnc 1000]] At exactly the same moment that Allaway was writing his essay for Artforum, Newsweek was singling out???Artforum in an article on, the growing, seminal import??ance of the art magazine. [[slnc 1000]] No longer the passive judge and recorder of art, the magazine is now part of the action. [[slnc 1000]] But at the same time, Allaway finds just as important the drastic increase in images of artists within mainstream non-specialist publications, depictions of art in lifestyle magazines, for instance. Or artists like Rauschenberg and Lichtenstein being drafted into designing covers of Time and Newsweek. [[slnc 1000]] Alloway also identified the rise of a consciousness of the art world as a defined subject with the new merchandising of art. Dedicating a long and brilliant passage, to analyzing the significance a Jackson Pollock jigsaw puzzle sold by the Albright Knox art gallery.

[[slnc 2000]]

These are still relatively primitive versions of the phenomena of art merging with the logics of commerce and design that Lee describes. [[slnc 1000]] A Jackson Pollock puzzle seems rather quaint next to Lady Gaga collabo??rating with Jeff Koons, or Barbara Kruger designing a W magazine cover with Kim Kar dashian. Or Rob Pruitt designing shoes for Jimmy Choo. [[slnc 1000]] However, such phenomena are part of a continuum with it. 

[[slnc 2000]] 

All this interpenetration of art with design and celebrity and commerce, is already baked in once you start using the term art world. Since it already implies, as Allaway says, a professional group in a situation su???ciently stable, not to demand continual conscious participation. [[slnc 1000]] It implies naturally a shallower, more mediated experience of art.???[[slnc 1000]] Allaway says this explicitly. One interpenetrated with a consciousness of itself as subject matter, for wider layers of media and visual culture. 

[[slnc 2000]]

We can trace a line through Warhol???s Brillo Boxes, as Dantoh analyzed them as the product of a star artist???s pronouncement that this is art, to his media-savvy heirs of the nineteen 80s. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol collaborator John Meshell Bosskeyot???s first painting on stretched canvas was done for a film, Downtown???81, in which he played the part of a down on his luck artist. [[slnc 1000]] The media image of Bosskeyot as a New York artist, literally preceded its realization as an actual thing, making it possible. 

[[slnc 2000]]

All this, finally, accounts for the weeird sense of assumed depth and actual superficiality that simultaneously accompanies the term art world, as it circulates unscrutinized. [[slnc 1000]] The term implies depth, in that talking about the art world signifies the existence of a community of shared professional interest. [[slnc 1000]] But it also suggests superficiality, in that this world does not, as Allaway says, demand continual conscious participation. And that it can be consumed as an image. [[slnc 1000]] In fact, the sense of being part of a community that requires no commitment to any specific ideal, is one of the things that the contemporary art industry sells.
