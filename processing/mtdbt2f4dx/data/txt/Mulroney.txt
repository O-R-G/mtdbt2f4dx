I???D RECOGNISE YOUR VOICE ANYWHERE

[[slnc 2000]] 

In 1964, Andy Warhol got his first tape recorder. [[slnc 1000]] After that, it never left his side. [[slnc 1000]] He brought it with him everywhere, giving it the pet name, my wife. [[slnc 1000]] Photographs of Warhol in public, often show him clutching it close to his body like a security blanket. [[slnc 1000]] He claimed that it changed his relationship to the world. [[slnc 1000]] The acquisition of my tape recorder really finished what??ever emotional life I might have had, Warhol explained. But I was glad to see it go. [[slnc 1000]] Nothing was ever a problem again, because a problem just meant a good tape. [[slnc 1000]] And when a problem transforms itself into a good tape, it???s not a problem anymore. [[slnc 1000]] Not only did his tape recorder turn problems into good tapes, but these tapes became material for Warhol???s many publications. Interviews for his magazine. Text for his books.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The first project Warhol used his tape recorder for, was his novel, Ay. Published by Grove Press in 1968. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol recalled: A friend had written me a note saying that everybody we knew was writing a book, so that made me want to keep up and do one too. [[slnc 1000]] So I bought a tape recorder, and I taped the most interesting person I knew at the time (Ondine) for a whole day. [[slnc 1000]] The novel was supposed to be a verbatim transcription of a day in the life of the verbose mercurial Factory superstar Ondine. [[slnc 1000]] Yet the story of the book???s production has become more notorious than the narrative contained therein. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol had planned to follow his subject around, for one whole day and night with his tape recorder. But later admitted that he got tired, and finished the taping on a few separate occasions. [[slnc 1000]] After the taping was finished (so the story goes), a couple of high school girls wandered into the Factory looking for work, and Warhol hired them on the spot, to transcribe the tapes into the manuscript for his novel. [[slnc 1000]] But these high school typists weren???t any good at transcription. [[slnc 1000]] They couldn???t spell or punctuate correctly, and they were very slow at their work. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol later complained: It took them a year and a half to type up one day! [[slnc 1000]] They had me convinced that typing was one of the slowest, most painstaking jobs in the world. [[slnc 1000]] Once the manuscript was finally transcribed, Warhol red it, and supposedly loved all the mistakes made by the inept typists. [[slnc 1000]] So he demanded that Grove Press publish the book as is, with no corrections or editorial changes.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The tapes for Ay, which reecord Ondine singing, eating, stuttering, and incessantly talking, as he travels around Manhattan high on amphetamines, are held in the archives of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh (along with the thousands of other audio tapes he recorded). [[slnc 1000]] A few years ago, I made my first trip to the archives, to listen to the tapes of Ondine. [[slnc 1000]] I wanted to understand what happened between the recording and the publishing of Ay. [[slnc 1000]] What fell away, or was distorted in the transcription process. [[slnc 1000]] Listening to the tapes, I found more than I expected. [[slnc 1000]] A soundscape of ambient noise, music, and the eccentric personalities that populated Warhol???s world in 1960s Manhattan. [[slnc 1000]] I also discovered the story of Warhol???s unedited novel was not exactly true. [[slnc 1000]] And there was something else too.

[[slnc 2000]] 

During one of my breaks from the headache inducing tapes of Ondine singing along to Maria Callas???(it may have taken the high school girls a year and a half to type up that one day, but it took me a full week to listen to it),???I took a walk through the Museum???s galleries, and came upon a letter addressed to Warhol. [[slnc 1000]] It referred to another of Warhol???s tape books. His book of philosophy, published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1975.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Dear Andy,

[[slnc 1000]] 

Bill Jovanovich red every word of your book last night, and is every bit as pleased by it as I am. [[slnc 1000]] What an incredible potpourri this book is, he???s written me. [[slnc 1000]] The long chapter of one of the Bees cleaning her apartment, and cleaning herself, is a masterpiece. The best exposition on the American cult of cleanliness since Franny and Zooey. [[slnc 1000]] Andy Warhol has a genius for the incongruous. [[slnc 1000]] Not since Oscar Wilde has anyone been better at injecting the unexpected, the immediately illuminating element, in a series of sensible things. [[slnc 1000]] How about that?

[[slnc 2000]] 

As I told you yesterday on the telephone, I am not going to try to edit the text closely, sentence by sentence. [[slnc 1000]] The book needs editing of a different sort (it is too long, certainly). [[slnc 1000]] Some chunks can be taken out whole, and maybe one or two chapters dropped altogether.

[[slnc 1000]] 

We must also think hard about the title. Bill suggests:

Thee. [[slnc 1000]] 
From A to B and Back Again. [[slnc 1000]] 
At the moment I am aiming for a publication date at the end of April. [[slnc 1000]] I promise to have my work completed by October 1st. [[slnc 1000]] The manuscript will very probably have to be ree typed. [[slnc 1000]] Then we can also talk in some detail about the design.

[[slnc 1000]] 

So, I couldn???t be happier. Bill Jovanovich couldn???t be happier. [[slnc 1000]] Both of us see a real triumph lying ahead. [[slnc 1000]] Your book is funny, your book is true. [[slnc 1000]] Some sections are superior to others, but even the chapters that are relatively poor, have marvellous things in them. And they all have perfect pitch. As Madame Henriette at C??te Basque said to you: I???d recognize your voice anywhere. [[slnc 1000]] Only it had been my voice.

[[slnc 1000]] 

It was good to see you last night. [[slnc 1000]] I???ll be in touch at the beginning of next week.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Yours ever,

[[slnc 1000]] 

Steven ML???Aronson

[[slnc 2000]] 

Written in September 1974 by Steven ML???Aronson, the co-publisher of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and the acquirer and editor of Warhol???s book, this letter explains several key facets of Warhol???s best known ??? or at least most quoted ??? book. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s book of philosophy is, in some ways, similar to his novel. [[slnc 1000]] Both were created from audiotapes. [[slnc 1000]] The stories of their production and the subjects of their narratives, both involved the cast of characters at the Factory. And both embraced the machinations of trade publishing. [[slnc 1000]] Interestingly, Aronson???s letter suggests that the original title for Warhol???s book was not, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, as it is commonly known. But simply,???Thee. A cryptic all-caps tag reminiscent of his novel???s lowercase Ay. [[slnc 1000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Yet Warhol???s Ay???and Thee, are also quite different. [[slnc 1000]] The letter from Aronson suggests that the publisher was enthusiastic about Warhol???s???Thee, because this book, unlike his novel, was readable and illuminating. [[slnc 1000]] We discover that the character named Bee, is not one person, but one of many. [[slnc 1000]] The book was to be edited, but not closely. [[slnc 1000]] The publisher expected the book to be a triumph. [[slnc 1000]] And then, in the final paragraph, Aronson adds his take to Jovanovich???s. [[slnc 1000]] Even the chapters that are relatively poor have marvellous things in them, and they all have perfect pitch (as Madame???Henriette at C??te Basque said to you: I???d recognize your voice anywhere. [[slnc 1000]] Only it had been my voice.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Is Aronson suggesting that Warhol???s voice in the manuscript is in fact, Aronson???s? And who is this Madame Henriette? Had she also red the manuscript, and then told Warhol that she recognized his voice, only it was Aronson???s? [[slnc 1000]] Is the book perhaps a composite of voices? [[slnc 1000]] Aronson???s, Bee???s, and unknown others, presented as Warhol???s? [[slnc 1000]] Given the way that Warhol wrote his books, all of these scenarios would be plausible.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The ability to recognize voices, I had learned, was an important facet of understanding Warhol???s books. [[slnc 1000]] This is in part, because the tapes in the Warhol Museum Archives pose particular challenges for researchers. [[slnc 1000]] They have not been transcribed. [[slnc 1000]] Many of the persons recorded on them have not been identified. [[slnc 1000]] And they are not necessarily dated or labelled accurately. [[slnc 1000]] It seems that Warhol, as zealous as he was at keeping his recorder running, did not keep detailed records of who, what and wenn he recorded. [[slnc 1000]] On top of that, the Andy Warhol Foundation strictly forbids researchers from taking notes while listening to the tapes. [[slnc 1000]] Therefore, trying not only to figure out who is speaking on the tapes, but also to remember what it was they said, becomes a kind of endurance test that, I cannot help feeling, would have pleased Warhol.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In listening to the tapes for Ay, I had become familiar with the voices of Ondine, Edie Sedgwick, Warhol, the Sugar Plum Fairy, and Rotten Rita. [[slnc 1000]] This made it possible for me to discern, in one of the novel???s most memorable episodes, a major editorial change. [[slnc 1000]] In chapter 12, Ondine has a conversation with a cab driver about eating cooked bulls??? balls. [[slnc 1000]] Only by now, I knew it was not Ondine yelling out the window to ask male pedestrians if they had ever heard of eating mounted mountains. [[slnc 1000]] It was Chuck Wein. [[slnc 1000]] And so I realized that Warhol???s unedited novel had, in fact, been substantively edited, in order to sustain the narrative of a day in Ondeen???s life, regardless of who Warhol???s tape recorder followed at any given moment. [[slnc 1000]]  

[[slnc 2000]] 

Aronson???s mysterious parenthetical comment about Madame Henriette, made me wonder exactly what kind of writing and editing process had taken place during the production of Warhol???s philosophy book. [[slnc 1000]] I procured a photocopy of Aronson???s letter from the archivist, and tucked it away in my notebook, only to return to the archives a few years later to listen to the tapes for Thee.

[[slnc 2000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Warhol Speaks! High time too. Red the opening lines of Barbara Goldsmith???s judicious review of Warhol???s???Thee, in???The New York Times Book Review. [[slnc 1000]] Acknowledging how the critical reception of the book hinged on the perceived authenticity???(or inauthenticity)???of Warhol???s authorial voice, Goldsmith continues. [[slnc 1000]] Our expectation, is that at last Warhol will interpret himself to us. [[slnc 1000]] And he does this by not doing it. While Goldsmith describes the parts of the book that tell us about Warhol???s adolescence as fresh and illuminating, she is careful to qualify her evaluation. [[slnc 1000]] The word autobiographical is not used here (Goldsmith writes) because one can???t be sure that Warhol did the actual writing. [[slnc 1000]] It doesn???t really matter. [[slnc 1000]] Which is his point exactly. [[slnc 1000]] It seems the critics???(whether at local papers or national magazines) had caught on to Warhol???s gambit. [[slnc 1000]] A critic for the Christian Science Monitor News Service, anticipated that Warhol???s book would be: a splendid performance, rich in narcissism and self-publicity. [[slnc 1000]] Functioning nicely in that no man???s land, between social history and put-on. [[slnc 1000]] The reviewer for Art in America wrote: Warhol???s audience may think that with this book, he has come out of the closet of his own myth. [[slnc 1000]] That at this strategic point of his career, he is revealing the intimate ins and outs of his life in front of the public. [[slnc 1000]] But whoever in the general public acquired this opinion, did so cheaply, through mere logical deduction. [[slnc 1000]] And thus, like a dog thrown a pacifying bone, deserves a happy choo. [[slnc 1000]] Even though the bone is vinyl.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Yet the publicity materials distributed by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, play on the reader???s desire to get the real Warhol. [[slnc 1000]] The spring catalogue copy reflects Jovanovich???s first impression, contending not only that the book is: an incredible potpourri. Astonishing, delighting, puzzling, funny. But above all, true. [[slnc 1000]] The brochure for the book, crafted to generate advance purchases from booksellers, went even further. [[slnc 1000]] This surprisingly candid self portrait reveals a shy, sensible, provocative, and often endearing personality, for perhaps the first time ever. [[slnc 1000]] The publisher may have served the book up as a true and revealing self-portrait. But the critics were quick to acknowledge this ploy with a nodd and a wink. [[slnc 1000]] The book itself incorporates both positions. [[slnc 1000]] Chapter one is titled: Bee and I. How Andy Puts His Warhol On. Suggesting, as Patrick Smith has pointed out, that Warhol???s persona is literally a daily put on. [[slnc 1000]] The chapter narrates how Warhol starts his day. [[slnc 1000]] I crawl to the bathroom, because I can???t shuffle, shuttle, tippy-toe or cakewalk, with a chocolate-covered cherry caught between my toes. [[slnc 1000]] I approach the sink. [[slnc 1000]] I raise my body slowly, and brace my arms against the stand. [[slnc 1000]] Then Warhol confides to Bee, who listens attentively on the other end of the line. [[slnc 1000]] I???m sure I???m going to look in the mirror and see nothing. [[slnc 1000]] This plotline is pure Warholian boilerplate. [[slnc 1000]] But is it really Warhol who is giving it to us? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Critic and artist Peter Plajjens, wrote a long review of???Thee for???Artforum, which he curiously titled: The Story of Ay. [[slnc 1000]] And in fact, his semi-dismissive analysis could be applied as easily to Warhol???s novel, as to his philosophy book. [[slnc 1000]] The book reads like it???s straight off the dictaphone. Transcribed in Lindy ballpoint drone. As though by an overweight 15 year old White Plains schoolgirl. [[slnc 1000]] Yet the central issue of Plajjens???s review is not the techniques of transcription and composition (which had been so important to the reception of Warhol???s novel), but instead, Warhol himself. [[slnc 1000]] A great deal of the public fascination with Warhol, Plajjens writes, concerns his apparent blithe gaiety, [[slnc 1000]] Does he fuck, suck, get fucked, or get sucked? [[slnc 1000]] Plagens???s aggressive queries as to Warhol???s sexual predilections, suggest that perhaps some of the public???s interest in finally getting at the true Warhol, was tied up with other ways of recognizing the artist. [[slnc 1000]] He further writes: We remain interested through all the ploys, because one question still remains. [[slnc 1000]] Does he mean it? [[slnc 1000]] Plajjens wants to know whether we are: actually in the presence of weird and original passion. [[slnc 1000]] Or are we being conned?

[[slnc 2000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

All of Warhol???s publications, are the product and presentation of multiple voices. [[slnc 1000]] From his early illustrated books, which were penned by his mother and hand colored by his friends (to his monthly glamor magazine Interview), Warhol relied on others to provide the content, and the labor. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s Factory, therefore, included not only Gerard Malanga, Billy Name, Brigid Polk, Pat Hackett and Bob Colachello, among others. [[slnc 1000]]  But also an extended network of editors and typesetters, lawyers and publicists, designers and printers. Some of whom worked for New York???s most important publishing houses. [[slnc 1000]] In the case of Warhol???s philosophy book, the collaborative mode in which it was produced, is signaled at the outset. [[slnc 1000]] The book???s dedication page reads:

[[slnc 1000]] 

To Pat Hackett, for extracting and redacting my thoughts so intelligently. [[slnc 1000]]
To beautiful Brigid Polk, for being on the other end. [[slnc 1000]]
To Bob Colachello, for getting it all together. [[slnc 1000]]
And to Steven ML Aronson, for being a great editor.

[[slnc 1000]] 

An editorial history in microcosm. [[slnc 2000]] We can deduce, from this dedication, that Pat Hackett worked with the audiotapes, pulling out and cleaning up Warhol???s thoughts. Brigid Polk was on the other end of all of those tape recorded phone calls. And Colachello served as the in house, managing editor. While Aronson turned the operation into a real book.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The duly acknowledged collaborative mode in which???Thee ???was produced, carries over into the narrative. [[slnc 1000]] The opening chapter not only signals the playfulness of the book???s premise in relationship to Warhol???s public persona, but also sets up the framework for what will follow. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s philosophy will be articulated in the form of a conversation. [[slnc 1000]] From Ay to Bee and Back Again. With Ay standing for Andy, and Bee for one or another of his friends. Given that two of his closest cohorts at the time had first names beginning with Bee, readers are left to guess whether Bee is for Bob, or for Brigid. [[slnc 1000]] In fact, Bee switches from a him to a her (and back again) over the course of the book.???[[slnc 1000]] Thee begins:

[[slnc 1000]] 

I wake up and I call Bee. [[slnc 1000]]
Bee is anybody who helps me kill time. [[slnc 1000]]
Bee is anybody, and I am nobody. [[slnc 1000]] Bee and I. [[slnc 1000]]
I need Bee because I can???t be alone. [[slnc 1000]] Except when I sleep. [[slnc 1000]] 
Then I can???t be with anybody. [[slnc 1000]]
I wake up and call Bee.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Warhol???s philosophy book might start out in the bedroom, but it doesn???t give readers like Plajjens the kind of lubricious information he believes they are after. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol makes a point of telling us that he sleeps alone.

[[slnc 2000]] 

But there are larger implications in this opening scene. [[slnc 1000]] The genius of Warhol, as Douglas Crimp has put it, was not least his uncanny ability always, to secure for himself the author function. [[slnc 1000]] And all the more so, by protesting that he rarely had all that much to do with making his work. Admitting openly that his work was really the yield of others. [[slnc 1000]] Others??? ideas, others??? designs, others??? images, others??? abilities, others??? labor. [[slnc 1000]] But the more Warhol protested, the more he, alone, was credited. [[slnc 1000]] Thus, Warhol???s name alone, appears on the cover of Thee, despite the fact that the book makes clear from the outset,???in its subtitle and on its dedication page,???that it is a collaboration.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Along those lines, the narrative structure of Warhol???s philosophy book is worth tracing, because it elucidates the ways in which Warhol???s voice includes the voices of his collaborators. [[slnc 1000]] Chapter 1 takes the form of a telephone conversation between Warhol and one of his anonymous female Bees. [[slnc 1000]] In chapter 2, the narrative switches from dialogue, to a series of aphoristic observations, articulated in the first person. [[slnc 1000]] The chapter takes the reader through Warhol???s thoughts on Love (Puberty), Love (Prime), and Love (Senility). [[slnc 1000]] Utilizing the same narrative technique, the next seven chapters address the subjects of Beauty, Fame, Work, Time, Death, Economics, and Atmosphere. [[slnc 1000]] After this section, which comprises about half of the book, the narrative returns to dialogue. [[slnc 1000]] Although conducted no longer on the phone, but rather on the couch. [[slnc 1000]] We find ourselves in Italy, with Ay and Bee, now male, sitting in the lobby of a fancy hotel. Watching the hairdressers of famous actresses follow them around. [[slnc 1000]] This dialogue continues over the next two chapters, as we accompany Ay and Bee, from Rome to Monty Carlo to Turin. [[slnc 1000]] These three chapters encompass the subjects of Success, Art, and Titles. [[slnc 1000]] Then the narrative shifts again, as does the sex of Bee. [[slnc 1000]] Ay and Bee are back on the phone. [[slnc 1000]] Bee launches into a monologue on her obsessive compulsive cleaning routine, which goes on breathlessly for 24 pages, ending only when Ay finally hangs up. [[slnc 1000]] In the book???s final chapter, Underwear Power, Ay and Bee (now mail again) go shopping for underwear and vintage jewelry on Saturday morning. [[slnc 1000]] Thus, Warhol???s philosophy book consists of three narrative voices. The first person aphorisms, presumably extracted and redacted by Pat Hackett. The phone calls with female Bs. (One guesses that this is Brigid Polk on the other end). And the transcripts of sightseeing and shopping with male Bees. [[slnc 1000]] Thus we might conclude, that Warhol???s philosophy is as much a composite of Pat Hackett???s ideas, Brigid Polk???s monologue, and Bob Colachello???s gossipy chit-chat, as it is the presentation of Warhol???s own thoughts.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In this way, the collaborative mash up that comprises the text of Warhol???s philosophy book, points us back to his experimental films of the 1960s. [[slnc 1000]] As Goldsmith points out in her review, the monologue in which Bee compulsively cleans her apartment, then herself, and then masturbates with a vibrator, is so reminiscent of The Chelsea Girls,???and passages from Ay (Warhol???s tedious tape recorded novel), that it???s downright old-fashioned. [[slnc 1000]] But Warhol???s book resembles his films in a different way as well. [[slnc 1000]] As Gregory Battcock wrote in his review of Thee:

[[slnc 1000]] 

The narrational process invented by Warhol, is very similar to the filming technique the artist developed in his amateur experimental movies of the mid 1960s. [[slnc 1000]] A carefully set up situation, will be interrupted by a sudden camera shift, to a detailed view of say, an elbow or a fragment of background. [[slnc 1000]] And that improbable, though certainly related detail, will be quickly erased by another sudden shift, as the camera zooms in on the rug. [[slnc 1000]] 

[[slnc 1000]] 

Thus, Warhol???s first serious literary document, is in many ways, thoroughly consistent with his iconographic decisions during the Pop Art days. [[slnc 1000]] And also consistent with the irritating, abrupt, disjointed cinematic technique, that he explored during the film making period that followed. [[slnc 1000]] Yet the book illustrates some unique approaches to trivia. [[slnc 1000]] For example, any true literary appreciation of trivia, would have to include an appreciation for error, [[slnc 750]] deliberate error. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s Philosophy is full of mistakes. But they are mistakes that do not matter. [[slnc 1000]] No mistake could possibly matter, in an investigation of the authentically trivial.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Battcock informs us that the name of the hotel in Turin is wrong, as is the narrative???s claim that it is the only first class hotel in the city. [[slnc 1000]] These are inconsequential errors, to be sure. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol???s mode of working (whether in painting, film, or writing) often involved the operations of chance, error, and distortion. [[slnc 1000]] What???s more to the point though, is how Warhol???s books, like his films, were important to those who worked on them. [[slnc 1000]] Thus, when Ondine describes his involvement in Warhol???s films, he explains that Warhol wasn???t featuring people doing things. [[slnc 1000]] He was allowing people to mirror himself in a way. [[slnc 1000]] I mean, he allowed me to create myself. And I allowed him to create himself. [[slnc 1000]] It???s the same kind of thing.

[[slnc 2000]] 

It seems to me, that Warhol???s philosophy book facilitated a similar kind of creative space as that in his films. [[slnc 1000]] A space in which Hackett, Polk, and Colachello would create themselves. Perform their roles as Bees. And, in so doing, allow Warhol to create himself. [[slnc 1000]] Yet this does not mean all of Warhol???s collaborators would feel as ree affirmed by working with Warhol as Ondine had. [[slnc 1000]] When New???York ???magazine published excerpts from???Thee, and put Warhol on the cover, Colachello felt eclipsed: 

[[slnc 1000]] 

They posed him in a closet, sitting at a typewriter, under a headline that red: ANDY WARHOL???S GREATEST SECRET. HE LIKES TO WRITE. [[slnc 1000]] It finally hit me then. [[slnc 1000]] I was part of a big lie. [[slnc 1000]] And while it had lined my pockets, it robbed my ego of any hope of recognition.

[[slnc 2000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

On one hand,???Thee ???can be understood as the sequel to Ay. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol had planned to do a book every five years after Ay, with Bee as the first sequel. [[slnc 1000]] Taping for Bee began in 1969, and Warhol recorded about seven hours of material, which included Ondine standing in line at Judy Garland???s funeral, going to Ultra Violet???s apartment and putting on makeup with Candy Darling, and ending up at some bar called Beef???n Brew. [[slnc 1000]] And that???s where we decided it was just not feasible, recalled Ondine. [[slnc 1000]] The first book was done on speed, and the second book wasn???t. So they abandoned it.

[[slnc 2000]] 

On the other hand,???Thee is a totally different kind of book from Ay. [[slnc 1000]] The idea for it came serendipitously. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol and Colachello were standing in the buffet line at a holiday brunch, hosted by the interior designer Ellen Lehman McCluskey. Behind them was Patrick O???Higgins (a long time Warhol friend, and the author of the bestseller, Madamme: a biography of his former employer, the cosmetics tycooness Helena Rubenstein). [[slnc 1000]] Who in turn, introduced them to his literary agent, Roz Mrs Carlton Cole. [[slnc 1000]] Colachello recalls: [[slnc 1000]] Roz told Andy that he should write his autobiography. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol responded that Colachello was already writing his biography. [[slnc 1000]] But Roz was very quick on her feet, answering Warhol: Well, why don???t you write your philosophy. [[slnc 1000]] I mean, if anyone has a philosophy, it???s got to be you. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol loved the idea, and assigned Colachello as ghost writer with the simple directive: [[slnc 1000]] Philosophy is anything Bob. [[slnc 1000]] Just make it up.

[[slnc 2000]] 

While the stories surrounding the taping and transcription of Warhol???s novel had contributed to the scandal of that book, the details about how Warhol???s philosophy book came to be, were not public knowledge. [[slnc 1000]] Years later, Pat Hackett would explain:

[[slnc 1000]] 

I did eight separate interviews with Andy, on the basis of which I wrote chap??ters 1 through 8, and chapter 10. [[slnc 1000]] Then, using material from conversa??ytions Andy had taped between himself and Bob Colachello and Brigid Berlin, I wrote the introductory chapter and chapters 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Colachello???s account is a bit more complicated:

[[slnc 1000]] 

Andy and I started tape-recording in hotels, lobbies and suites, in between appointments. [[slnc 1000]] Andy always wanted to tape record the Sex chapter, and the Love chapter. And I was like: Andy, you know, we???ve got to do philosophy like space, and time, and ethics. [[slnc 1000]] Andy would give the tapes that he and I made to Pat Hackett. [[slnc 1000]] She was typing up the tapes, and then I was supposed to start writing the first chapter. [[slnc 1000]] And I wrote a draft of the first chapter. [[slnc 1000]] Pat had this idea. She said: Well, maybe we can use all of these clips of all these terrible things that people say about Andy. [[slnc 1000]] I wrote the first chapter based on the tapes. [[slnc 1000]] And then Andy typically gave it to Pat, who rewrote it. And then he read the ree-write to Brigid Berlin, and tape recorded that. Gave that tape to Pat, and she reintegrated Brigid???s comments. [[slnc 1000]] And so now it was becoming more and more like Ay and Bee. [[slnc 1000]] Because I was sort of the original Bee. But then Brigid became like another Bee. [[slnc 1000]] There???s one chapter where Bee is like me and Vincent combined. [[slnc 1000]] But I don???t want to take anything away from Pat, because she actually did, in the end, more work than me. [[slnc 1000]] The cleaning chapter was just straight from Brigid in the hotel in Washington. [[slnc 1000]] That was a total Brigid monologue, which she is completely capable of. [[slnc 1000]] The Shopping for Underwear chapter: that???s me and Vincent with Andy. [[slnc 1000]] We went to Gimbels and Macy???s, because they were across from each other on 34th Street. And again it was Pat who transcribed the tapes, and Pat who got them into a more literary form. [[slnc 1000]] Although I did that, I know, on the chapters that we did in Monty Carlo, As I recall. [[slnc 1000]] The way they were published was pretty much the way that I transcribed them. [[slnc 1000]] Because as I was transcribing, I was shaping them in a way. [[slnc 1000]] You know, it is hard to remember exactly. [[slnc 1000]] But it was definitely a collaboration, like so many of Andy???s things beyond just paintings. [[slnc 1000]] And even some of his paintings.

[[slnc 1000]] 

And then there was the editor, Aronson:

[[slnc 1000]] 

I expunged whole hunks of the book that (since I can???t recall them) must have been as unmemorable as they are unrememberable. [[slnc 1000]] Then I proceeded to hire a freelance typist, who sat outside my office on the 9th floor, clicking away, because I didn???t want to let the manuscript out of the building. [[slnc 1000]] Andy and Bob voiced no objections to any of the cuts. [[slnc 1000]] And so then I sat down to do the line work. [[slnc 1000]] Whatever I said or did went. [[slnc 1000]] And Andy always claimed he was very happy with the way it read.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Before turning the manuscript over to Aronson, Warhol had also been involved with the shaping and editing of the text. [[slnc 1000]] According to Colachello, he and Warhol had worked together on the manuscript, and Warhol would tear it apart: with amazing clarity of vision sometimes, fumbling abstract intuition other times. [[slnc 1000]] Always making it better. [[slnc 1000]] In addition, Aronson recalls that: Andy surprised me in being interested in every aspect of the publishing process. [[slnc 1000]] So much so that he became something of a nuisance, calling regularly for staytus updates.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The process by which???Thee was published then, involved taping, transcreye??bing, retaping, re-transcreye??bing, editing, reteyeping, formatting the manuscript. And also running it by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich???s libel lawyer, Paul Git lin, to make sure that nothing in the book would prompt a lawsuit against the publisher. [[slnc 1000]] Git lin raised a number of concerns, including the identity of Taxi (whom critics recognized as a thinly veiled Edie Sedgwick), references made to famous personalities, and the use of Shrimp, to describe Ursula Andress???s stature. [[slnc 1000]] Aronson responded to Git lin???s points in writing: no one will be able to come forward and say she is Taxi. A true statement, given that Sedgwick had passed away three years earlier. [[slnc 1000]] Aronson informs Git lin that: Franco Rossellini has given us written permission to publish the reference to him. And that the line, Bobby Beausoleil (who???s in jail for the Charles Manson murders) is one of the most handsome people I???ve ever seen, has been deleted from the text. [[slnc 1000]] Aronson continues: With your permission, we have substituted Midget for Shrimp, each time it appears in these pages. [[slnc 1000]] After our conversation yesterday afternoon, I told Warhol that under no circumstances could Shrimp be reinstated.???Yet neither Shrimp nor Midget is used in the published book. In the end, they decided for some reason, that it was safer to describe Ursula Andress as a Peanut.

[[slnc 2000]] 

From the prompt by the literary agent, to the conversations captured by Warhol???s tape recorder. [[slnc 1000]] From the multiple transcribers, to the multiple ghostwriters. [[slnc 1000]] From the editor to the libel lawyer. Warhol???s philosophy book encompasses the voices of a number of people,  who worked with him in what was a highly complex process of publication. [[slnc 1000]] The book is credibly an incredible potpourri.

[[slnc 2000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

When I returned to archives at the Warhol Museum to listen to the tapes for???Thee, I came with the assumption that I would not hear Warhol himself on them. [[slnc 1000]] On the audiotapes for Ay, Warhol had been almost mute. Offering only the periodic, oh, really; and: come on, Ondine.

[[slnc 2000]] 

To date, only 14 of the thousands of cassette tapes in the archives have been identified as relating to the philosophy book. [[slnc 1000]] The first tape I listened to was of Warhol, Fred Hughes, Bob Colachello, Vincent Fremont, and Pat Hackett having lunch at a restaurant, and discussing who the great philosophers are. [[slnc 1000]] Nietzsche, Kierky guard, Schopenhauer, Kant. [[slnc 1000]] Then Angelica Huston and Jack Nicholson show up, and the conversation shifts. [[slnc 1000]] As far as I could tell, nothing from this tape made its way into the book. [[slnc 1000]] The next tape was of Polk and Colachello talking on the phone. [[slnc 1000]] Colachello keeps saying that the tape is bad, and that they are not getting anything done. [[slnc 1000]] He impersonates Warhol for a while. Then he and Polk talk about royal families, and whether or not Warhol wants to be part of high society. [[slnc 1000]] It is clear that they are trying to come up with material for Warhol???s book. Although, as far as I could tell, nothing from this tape made it into the book either. [[slnc 1000]] The next tape was of a party at Halston???s. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol is there, presumably holding the tape recorder. [[slnc 1000]] He is talking to a Brazilian model named Sylvia. [[slnc 1000]] Music throbs in the background, and there are lots of kissing sounds and laughter. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol asks Sylvia for her thoughts on beauty. [[slnc 1000]] She tells him: You want to be like the photograph of you, and you can???t ever look that way. [[slnc 1000]] And so you start to copy the photograph. [[slnc 1000]] These lines are actually in??? Thee. But the rest of the paragraph before and after are not spoken by Sylvia (or anyone else) on the tape. [[slnc 1000]] A little later on, Warhol tells Sylvia that Diana Vreeland is a really great person. [[slnc 1000]] Sylvia interjects that Vreeland, is one of the most beautiful women in the world, which also appears in the book. But the rest of the sentence is not spoken by Warhol or Sylvia on the tape. [[slnc 1000]] There are other tapes which, like this one, may include snippets that made it into???Thee. [[slnc 1000]] On one tape, Nikki Weymouth and Paloma Picasso talk about their dreams. [[slnc 1000]] On another, a live rock band plays songs in which the lyrics are things like: Warhol puts it on, and, Warhol is nothing, does nothing.

[[slnc 2000]] 

I was beginning to think, there was no way to unravel the relationship between the tapes and the text produced from them. [[slnc 1000]] But the sixth tape surprised me. [[slnc 1000]] It was labeled, Wednesday July 3rd, 1974. Philosophy AW and PH, on Time. [[slnc 1000]] Chapter seven of Thee ???is titled, Time, which was a good sign. [[slnc 1000]] On the tape, I heard two voices: Warhol???s, and Hackett???s. [[slnc 1000]] She asks Warhol all sorts of questions, and he starts talking. [[slnc 1000]] They have a real conversation. They laugh. [[slnc 1000]] And Warhol says things that are in the book, such as: People say, time on my hands. Well, I look at my hands, and I see a lot of lines. [[slnc 1000]] When the conversation slows down, or Warhol gets stuck, Hackett offers some answers to her own questions. And Warhol says: Oh, that???s great. Can you put that in my language? [[slnc 1000]] Near the end of the tape, Warhol begins to improvise:

[[slnc 1000]] 

From time to time [[slnc 750]]
Doo time [[slnc 750]]
Time yourself [[slnc 1000]] 

weekends. [[slnc 1000]]

In time [[slnc 750]]
In no time [[slnc 750]]

[[slnc 1000]] 

The tapes for Thee not only record what Warhol and others said. But they also convey the tone, in which these statements were made. [[slnc 1000]] The cynical mantra, Business art is the step that comes after Art. Being good at busi??ness is the most fascinating kind of Art, sounded, to me, like a sincere conceptual project. [[slnc 1000]] In contrast, Warhol couldn???t sound more mocking of his fellow painters??? pretentions, when he delivers an affectation of how he himself paints:

[[slnc 1000]] 

I look at my canvas, and I space it out right. [[slnc 1000]] I think: Well, over here in this corner, it looks like it sort of belongs. And so I say, Oh yes, that???s where it belongs all right. [[slnc 1000]] So I look at it again, and I say: The space in that corner there needs a little blue. [[slnc 1000]] And so I put my blue up there, and then, then I look over there and it looks blue over there, so I take my brush and I move it over there, and I make it blue over there too. [[slnc 1000]] And then it needs to be more spaced. So I take my little blue brush, and I blue it over there. And then I take my green brush, and I put my green brush on it, and I green it there. And then I walk back and I look at it, and see if it???s spaced right.

[[slnc 1000]] 

So it was Warhol. [[slnc 1000]] But it was also of course, Pat Hackett, Brigid Polk, Bob Colachello, Vincent Fremont, and Sylvia, among many others. [[slnc 1000]] During the week I spent at the archives, I recognized many voices. [[slnc 1000]] But I never managed to work out who Madame Henriette was (the woman Aronson had invoked in his letter; the woman who had said to Warhol: I???d recognize your voice anywhere.)

[[slnc 2000]]

So I asked Aronson if he could explain. [[slnc 1000]] He told me:

[[slnc 1000]] 

In September 1974, I wanted to take Andy somewhere special, to mark the occasion of his having turned in the book, more or less on time. And I suggested La Grenouille, the most fashionable restaurant in the city. But he subversively said that he would prefer La C??te Basque. [[slnc 1000]] Since I didn???t frequent it, and wasn???t known there, I made the reservation in his name rather than mine, and evidently spelled it for them. [[slnc 1000]] I happened to arrive at the restaurant at the same time as Andy and Bob, and we all went in together. [[slnc 1000]] Madame Henriette greeted Andy with, You didn???t have to spell your name, Mr. Warhol. I???d recognize your voice anywhere.

[[slnc 1000]] ???
At that, I couldn???t contain myself. [[slnc 1000]] Apparently you don???t, I said, because it was my voice. [[slnc 1000]] I???m the one who spoke with you. She just glared at me, and Andy looked. Embarrassed? Amused? Both? Neither? Henriette Spalter, by the way, was a vintage figure in the annals of classic New York dining. She had started out as the coat check girl and cashier at Henri Soules legendary Pavillon restaurant, of which La C??te Basque was a slightly less expensive offshoot. His Pavillon for the Poor, Soule called it. [[slnc 1000]] She was also his girlfriend, and inherited the restaurant from him when he died. [[slnc 1000]] Madamme was a tough number, and a very vigilant gatekeeper. And there must have been a touch of Spartacus to the young me, to have dared to engage her in combat like that. [[slnc 1000]] But then, come to think of it, what did I have to lose? [[slnc 1000]]???I preferred La Grenouille!

[[slnc 1000]] 

No sooner had we been seated, than Andy told me that I had to help him come up with a new opening line for the book. [[slnc 1000]] He had just red the columnist Rona Barrett???s autobiography, Miss Rona, and had been grabbed by her first line. Wherein she recounted how a Hollywood leading man (Andy said he???d heard it was Kirk Douglas)???had begged her: Let me put it in an inch Rona! Just one inch! [[slnc 1000]] So now Andy was hell bent on having his philosophy book open in a similarly pornographic vein. [[slnc 1000]] I said: Look, Rona Barrett is a gossipist. You are an artist, and a would-be philosophist. [[slnc 1000]] Nor are you sleeping with any Hollywood leading man (that I know of). [[slnc 1000]] In fact, there are no points of comparison. And you don???t need to stoop to that level. [[slnc 1000]] He said, I like that level. It???s a great level. I said: Forget it. And mercifully he did.

[[slnc 2000]] 

On what level should we situate Warhol???s philosophy book? [[slnc 1000]] It might be above the level of Miss Rona. [[slnc 1000]] But in truth, it seems closer to Truman Capotey???s unfinished novel, Answered Prayers,???than the text based works that fellow artists were producing at the time (such as Hans Haacke???s infamous Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings (in which the artist gathered and presented data that revealed the network of individuals who controlled large areas of urban housing). [[slnc 1000]] While both Capotey and Haacke publicly exposed the social and economic elite (albeit in radically different ways), Warhol???s entanglement with the politics of the elite, seemed to be moving in a different direction.

[[slnc 2000]] 

At the same time that Warhol signed the contract to publish Thee, with Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, he also signed a contract to collaborate with Paulette Goddard on her memoirs. [[slnc 1000]] The beautiful movie star (who had been married to Charlie Chaplin, Burgess Meredith, and the novelist Eric Maria Remarque). [[slnc 1000]] And at one time or another along the way, had been involved with Diego Rivera, HG ???Wells, General George Patton, and Clark Gable, among others. [[slnc 1000]] As Aronson recalls: Bob confected a tantalizing out line. [[slnc 1000]] Andy would tape Paulette assiduously, as she spilled the proverbial beans to him. [[slnc 1000]] And the result would amount to no less than an audio documentary. The books were (to some extent) a package deal. [[slnc 1000]] Colachello explains: They were to be titled Thee,  and Her, respectively. [[slnc 1000]] (And if and when Andy did an autobiography, that would be called Me.) But whenever the tape recorder was running, Goddard refused to reveal anything remotely intimate. [[slnc 1000]] At the end of a year, Andy handed me 700 pages??? worth of essentially worthless stuff, Aronson said. [[slnc 1000]] A welter of idle conversation about her best friends, which were Persian rugs, caviar, Impressionist paintings, furs, and jewels. [[slnc 1000]] The manuscript was a bore, and the book was rejected.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Meanwhile, Thee was having its own problems. It was failing to generate any heat in the marketplace. [[slnc 1000]] The original plan was to publish it in April 1975. [[slnc 1000]] But in February, we were forced to postpone it until September, Aronson explains, Because booksellers weren???t ordering in sufficient numbers, and there was no interest to speak of, from book clubs and paper??back reprint houses. [[slnc 1000]] Given that the United States was in a recession, and that Saigon fell to the People???s Army on April 30th 1975, it???s no surprise that a tongue in cheek book of philosophy, by the Pope of Pop, was not being roundly embraced. [[slnc 1000]] Aronson asked Jovanovich himself to reassure Warhol, which the chairman did in a four page handwritten letter. [[slnc 1000]] We are not at fault. Neither are you, he explained. It was only that the reprint publishers and book clubs do not believe your name will draw in the field of books. [[slnc 1000]] Now we will seek to change their minds!

[[slnc 2000]] 

The publishing house did everything it could to promote Warhol???s book. [[slnc 1000]] Excerpts from Thee appeared in magazines as diverse as Cosmopolitan, Playboy Enterprises??? Oui, and on the cover of New York magazine. [[slnc 1000]] Excerpts even appeared in the New York Times. [[slnc 1000]] On the Op-ed page, where quotes about hair were picked, because it was during the serious local metropolitan hair crisis and hairdresser fad. [[slnc 1000]] According to Colachello, Warhol signed thousands of copies of the first printing of the book. And when those sold out, he went back to the warehouse to sign more. [[slnc 1000]] Aronson secured blurbs from Tina Turner, Rudolf Nur yev, and Truman Capotey. [[slnc 1000]] Leo Castelli and Halston gave book parties. And then Warhol went on tour. Eight cities in 16 days, accompanied by Colachello, Fred Hughes, Jed Johnson, and Lady Ann Lambton, an English socialite and Warhol Factory worker. [[slnc 1000]] Our first stop was Baltimore, where two thousand fans mobbed the Museum of Fine Art to see Andy. [[slnc 1000]] They wanted him to sign their hands, their arms, their foreheads, their clothes, and their money. [[slnc 1000]] Then in Saint Louis, Andy was put on display in the corner window of the Stix Baer Fuller department store, with a table piled with books. [[slnc 1000]] Giant speakers blasted the Velvet Underground???s Heroin, out into the downtown streets.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Not all the cities greeted Warhol with such enthusiasm. [[slnc 1000]] In San Francisco, someone left a death threat for Warhol at the Fairmont Hotel. [[slnc 1000]] At the book signing, some fans wanted to know, why Andy hadn???t come out in his Philosophy book. Why he???d sold out to business art. [[slnc 1000]] Colachello recalled: One particularly belligerent fellow in a work shirt came up to Fred and me, and demanded to know why we were wearing ties. [[slnc 1000]] The tie is a symbol of capitalist oppression, he insisted. And Andy used???to stand for liberation. [[slnc 1000]] You guys are nothing but a bunch of Fascists.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Fan letters in the archives give another side of the story. [[slnc 1000]] Some readers really identified with Warhol???s book. [[slnc 1000]] For example, John Waters sent Warhol a postcard on which he wrote: Andy, your book was the smile of the summer. [[slnc 1000]] One of Warhol???s old friends from the Bodley Gallery, expressed his happiness for Warhol and his anticipation of his new book. [[slnc 1000]] Someone named Roxanne wrote Warhol after reading the excerpt in Cosmopolitan. [[slnc 1000]] The section titled???Love was great. [[slnc 1000]] First of all, there sitting on the page was my favorite word, schizophrenia. [[slnc 1000]] I really love schizophrenia. It???s so misunderstood. [[slnc 1000]] And there was Rick from Cleveland, who crafted a letter to Warhol in an Ay to Bee and Back Again dialog format, to ask for help in finding a job.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Yet, Thee never quite caught on. [[slnc 1000]] It wound up selling a respectable number of copies, but fell far short of becoming a bestseller like Miss Rona, as Warhol had hoped. [[slnc 1000]] Nor did it find a place within the context of the text based art practices of the 1970s.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Let???s give the last word to Aronson, the editor:

[[slnc 2000]] 

There came the day, a month or two after publication, when Andy called and asked me impatiently: What can I do to make the book a bestseller? I told him that it was all over. [[slnc 1000]] Then he asked me point blank if it was a dud. [[slnc 1000]] I said: No, I wouldn???t describe it that way.[[slnc 1000]]  No book of Andy???s, it turned out, would ever appeal to the masses. [[slnc 1000]] Maybe the philosophy book would have caught on, if Andy had been articulate, and could have given interviews expressing his philosophy. [[slnc 1000]] It clearly wasn???t enough just to embody it. [[slnc 1000]] No one had ever known what Andy really thought, or how he thought. Or even if he thought. [[slnc 1000]] And whatever you want to say about Thee, it did add up to the most extensive personal statement he had yet made. [[slnc 1000]] He told me that he felt the book could give people a way that they could think too. [[slnc 1000]] And that they could use it to help solve their own problems. [[slnc 1000]] He said he saw it as a kind of self-help book. [[slnc 1000]]Which turned out to be funny, given that it didn???t help any of us.
