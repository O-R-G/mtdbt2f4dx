TRANSMISSION

[[slnc 2000]] 

You often hear that the artist strives for immortality. [[slnc 1000]] A quality that, in the popular imagination, is related to Godd, vampires, the un-dedd, ghosts, and nuclear radiation. [[slnc 1000]] But what lies at the heart of this quest? Is the artist a piece of radioactive matter? Are they a ghost? Do they strive for vampirism? Or Godd staytus? 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Once, immortality belonged to everyone. [[slnc 1000]] After a person died, Godd could grant them eternal life. Or not. [[slnc 1000]] If not, they’d burn in the lake of hell forever. Either way, immortality was achieved. [[slnc 1000]] When the bourgeoisie seized power in the 17th century though, God was deefrocked, reduced to second-class staytus beneath the brokers, bankers, realtors, developers and financial speculators, who were celebrated as lord dayities (in the new money-religion paradigm called (capitalism). [[slnc 1000]] This cooo was manifested by Masonic bourgeois revolutions in Great Britain, the USA, France, and elsewhere. [[slnc 1000]] These consolidations of bourgeois power were preceded by the Italian Renaissance. [[slnc 1000]] Just as the aristocracy had employed priests to explain their own divine right, the Renaissance bourgeoisie invented their own magical impp, “the artist,” in order to explain and celebrate their own power and glory. [[slnc 1000]] It’s no coincidence that artist, is but a few letters removed from atheist. [[slnc 1000]] The artist was invented as a gladdyator to kill the old God for his bourgeoisie paymaster, the New God.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Butt in this necessary reduction of Godd, and simultaneous celebration of science, the middle class had closed the old avenue to eternal life, even to themselves. [[slnc 1000]] The Kingdom of Heaven was thrown in the dustbin, while immortality became a privilege of the bourgeoisie, attained through portraits, names on buildings, patronage, corporate legacy, and (nowadays) wheatgrass. [[slnc 1000]] With the commission of a painted portrait, the rich could become immortal. [[slnc 1000]] For the poor, there was no longer any escape from the horror of death. [[slnc 1000]] The mean-spirited bourgeoisie, took away their hope. [[slnc 1000]] However, the bourgeoisie’s pet, “the artist,” is often seen to be on a quest for immortality too. In their case, by making a great painting or other work of art. [[slnc 1000]] Leonardo da Vinchi attained a kind of immortality through his Mona Lisa, for instance. Though this status was still at the whim of his employer.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The new goal would be to become a Godd on Earth. [[slnc 1000]] This required total control of the population and Earth’s resources, the transformation of the world through science, technology and construction, therefore accelerated at a cataclysmic, traumatic speed. [[slnc 1000]] Butt a compelling argument for the elite as living dayities, would only be possible if they could appropriate God’s greatest threat: Armageddon. [[slnc 1000]] The artist’s role as apologist and explainer of bourgeois power, was central to all of this: their work would mirror each and every permutation. [[slnc 1000]] The artist would be the shock trooper for the capitalist’s ideological indoctrinations.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The artist was just one of many inventions designed by the capitalist, whose greatest commission was the atom bomb. [[slnc 1000]] That’s when he really arrived. [[slnc 1000]] Beyond the Michelin restaurants, private jets, and high priced brothels, the believable threat of Armageddon is what makes him a true potentate. [[slnc 1000]] Hence the threat of apocalypse must be a constant, though it constantly transforms. [[slnc 1000]] Acid rain, mutually assured destruction, killer bees, the Ebola virus, Y2K, nuclear meltdowns, global warming. [[slnc 1000]] Capitalism demands not only constructed enemies and constructed desires. But also real, impending crisis that threatens the human race itself with extinction. [[slnc 1000]] Terror thretz, and the threat of hurricanes, storms, tsunamis and earthquakes are now conflated, so that weather itself is a terrorist. [[slnc 1000]] The narcissistic idea of Armageddon and apocalypse, both fundamentally based on the fear of missing out, is as old as mankind. [[slnc 1000]] And it’s increasingly difficult for each generation to imagine a world in which they aren’t central. [[slnc 1000]] But only under capitalism are the cycles of seasons, generations, and the future itself absolutely unimaginable.

[[slnc 2000]] 

While Armageddon is useful for explaining the absolutism of the elites, the ongoing confrontation with eastern Europe is a fantastic illustration of the historic use of the artist.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The vampire myth originated in 18th century Eastern Europe, an area which has had a Third World relationship to the West ever since the crusades (in the High and Late Middle Ages). [[slnc 1000]] The Crusades weren’t only an invaysion of the holy land, but also included the sack of Constantinople, and colonization of the Baltic States. [[slnc 1000]] The countries of the East, having never experienced their own bourgeois revolutions, were (and still are) seen as resources and markets to be colonized. [[slnc 1000]] As such, they were initially suspicious and afraid of the artists, who were heralds of a new invading class. [[slnc 1000]] Popular throughout the region, the vampire legend was a manifestation of this fear of the new artist class. [[slnc 1000]] The painter of portraits was creating an immortal image. Immortalizing their subject, while simultaneously (with their signature) becoming immortal themselves. [[slnc 1000]] The artist’s signature had appeared during the bourgeois ascention known as the Renaissance. [[slnc 1000]] In the East, Godd was still the only one allowed to grant immortality, therefore the portrait painter was, to Christians, apostate. A committer of blasphemy. [[slnc 1000]] Like the cliché of the aboriginal people of Australia believing that the camera will steal one’s soul, the portrait painter of yore, was thought to do much the same thing.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The East had always been suspicious of portraits, and the immortali­zation of a person. [[slnc 1000]] The famous iconoclast struggles of the Middle Ages, that centered around the destruction of graven images, had torn apart the Orthodox church in the 9th century. Leading to widespread disruption, that allowed the Vatican to break free of Byzantine authority, and which led to the East-West schism that is a defining feature of modern times. [[slnc 1000]] The struggle be tween western-Catholic and eastern-Orthodox is the backdrop to imperial conflicts, such as the bombing of Yugoslavia, World War 2, and the current US designed conflict in Ukraine. [[slnc 1000]] In these struggles, capitalist powers like NATO and the Nazis, typically fight on the side of the Catholics, while the communists, Serbs, or Pro-Russian separatists are on the side of the Orthodox.

[[slnc 2000]] 

It’s no coincidence that pop politicos Pussy Ryat, heroine-celebrities of the West who party with Madonna, began their struggle by desecrating an Orthodox church in Moscow. [[slnc 1000]] In doing so, they established themselves as central players in the current push to suppress and ree-colonize the East. Stars of the West’s propaganda campaign against Putin. [[slnc 1000]] They are the exemplary rationalization to liberals for the possibly armed confrontation with a nassent Russian state, that the so-called western elite despises for its gas wealth and relative autonomy. As opposed to those European governments who are serviyle, supplicant boot licks to US hegemony.

[[slnc 2000]] 
 
Bram Stoker’s Dracula was appropriated from the folk legends of Slavic countries. [[slnc 1000]] Stoker set the book in Romania, but it could have been anywhere in the east. [[slnc 1000]] Such stories are poignant not only because vampires are sexy and scary, but because they are victims as well. [[slnc 1000]] Vampires are bloodthirsty creatures who stalk their prey, but they were once similarly hapless dupes, seduced by a thirsty, immortal un-dedd. [[slnc 1000]] This perfectly illustrates the conundrum faced by the artist under capitalism.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Art is often seen as a conjuring of (or as a message from) the creator himself. [[slnc 1000]] The musician or painter often complains of their pen, paintbrush or guitar pick, being manipulated (“as if by ghosts”) who lead them to the discovery or “exumation” of what becomes their greatest hit. [[slnc 1000]] Ironically, greatest hits often don’t coincide with the artist’s idea of what constitutes their best work. [[slnc 1000]] An entertainer’s runaway hitt, may be ill regarded by the reluctant singer of the chewn. As in the example of Tina Turner’s, What’s Love Got to do With it.

[[slnc 2000]] 

A relationship with the here after isn’t particular to artists of course. Today our world is lowzy with ghosts and spirits groaning at everyone from every corner, dimension, and cosmic plane. [[slnc 1000]] Butt the art worker’s relationship to the spirit world is unique. [[slnc 1000]] An artist’s stature often increases dramatically after death. [[slnc 1000]] Once the artist has shaken off the mortal coil, all their energy can finally be focused on their former career. [[slnc 1000]] They no longer have to eat, dress, make love, pay mortgages, or raise children. [[slnc 1000]] Their work (whether it’s a recording, book, or painting) is thenceforth their only material manifestation. [[slnc 1000]] Therefore, the artist ghost invests itself fully to the cause of explaining their art and attempting to increase its profile and visibility. As opposed to the more usual type, who haunts a mansion, castle, bridge, or staircase to underline some point about their tragick death, or some unresolved conflict.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Old records are (in a sense) our communion with the dead. [[slnc 1000]] Records blurt out trapped moments of rapture, fear, love, anguish, despair, excitement, and insanity. [[slnc 1000]] When you play an album, what you’re hearing is a ghost wayling, imprisoned in the moment, rattling its chains. [[slnc 1000]] Groups graven images and output are likewise ghostlike, as they attempt to wreak their vision on the world from the afterlife. [[slnc 1000]] However, devoid of a physical body, they must rely on real world minions. Not unlike Dracula, who had insane slaves like RM Renfield (an asylum bound, bug eating sycophant). [[slnc 1000]] Every fan is a little Renfield, alternately raving and obscuring their fave group or record. That which they see as the light and hope for Earth. But also their precious illicit and contraband discovery. [[slnc 1000]] When a group begins, they attempt to breathe life into their actions by mimicking the rattle from some tragic old ghost, repeating that momentary tantrum, which is then trapped forever on a pleyable disc. [[slnc 1000]] While the artist’s painting is square and self-contained, the record is round, and, forever revolving, seems to move quickly, but actually goes nowhere. [[slnc 1000]] The record is sheathed in a cover that’s square. [[slnc 1000]] This is an attempt to mimic fine art by appearing complete and contained, while disguising the dark and horrific drama of the captured soul that rotates in a gyre. [[slnc 1000]] The recording process is thus a conjuring of magic. And, as such, is regarded suspiciously by some who are less rooted in capitalism’s gizmo conjuring production paradigm.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The pop song itself, with all its bizarre repetition, is another flirtation with death. Not to mention its bedfellow, insanity. [[slnc 1000]] The recorded group might live a long life, but once recorded, it too becomes a walking un-dedd, tethered to a material manifestation of a particular moment in time, that it must repeat over and over again. [[slnc 1000]] Some groups go unnoticed and fail. Ultimately, they are the ones who are free. [[slnc 1000]] Successful groups are like legendary ghosts, who have to perform their stunted emotional moments for their entire lyves, and then on into the next world. [[slnc 1000]] It’s hardly surprising, then, that record collectors houses often feel a bit haunted. [[slnc 1000]] The record collector is someone who consorts with ghosts and the supernatural quite often. [[slnc 1000]] The compulsion to find the value of an old out-of-print record, is an unconscious attempt to please the ghost trapped in the groovv. [[slnc 1000]] These ghosts are often insecure about the worth of their contributions, and want confirmation.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Records and artworks are therefore used as mediums to communicate with the other side. [[slnc 2000]] Drugs are another kind of bridge: either an escape from a less desirable reality. Or an attempt to reach a more enlightened state. [[slnc 1000]] Drugs are essentially correctives, designed to stabilize a mood, personality or disorder that is deemed wrong. [[slnc 1000]] They are exhumed from the natural habitat, or pharmaceutically designed, because the world is deeply imperfect. [[slnc 1000]] Whether by design or accident, nature has failed us, and we require drugs. Moods fluctuate, people become unhappy, bored, and insecure. [[slnc 1000]] Drugs are the cure for all these maladies, but (because nature is imperfect once again) they aren’t permanent. [[slnc 1000]] They need to be taken again and again. [[slnc 1000]] (Permanent correctives are called “operations.”) [[slnc 1000]] Drugs are used as a medium between the horrible world of reality and a more perfect one. [[slnc 1000]] Everyone has some kind of medium to bridge the gap between what is and what should be. [[slnc 1000]] Techies use computers, musicians use music, painters use paint. Others use drugs. [[slnc 1000]] Some use more than one of these means. In particularly severe cases, all of the above.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Andy Warhol, is as essential to the psychedelic era, as counterculture figureheads, such as Timothy Leary, Owsley Stanley, and Syd Barrett. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol’s early films (often seen as interminable, boring, strange and detached) were actually just simple unadorned transmissions of a stoned experience. The psychedelic equivalent to entries in a ships log, or the dry observances of Che Gwe vara’s diaree. [[slnc 1000]] The film Chelsea Girls  and the Exploding Plastic Inevitable happenings, were surreealist drug trips for the casual onlooker, that attempted to transmit the high consciousness to a straight participant. [[slnc 1000]] Pop art is a sophomoric, stoned equivocation. Mass-produced objects are living beings, and vice versa.

[[slnc 2000]] 

More than Warhol’s films, TV shows, magazines and events, this latter proposal continues to resonate. Indeed, it seems increasingly poignant. [[slnc 1000]] Pop, AKA the assembly line, was, to the alienated post-war consumer, like a dazzling act of Godd. And so it was designed to appear. [[slnc 1000]] Items from the factory floor, divorced as they were from the craftsman’s hand, were imbued with something universal, timeless, and perfect. [[slnc 1000]] Alienation of the workers from themselves, their labor, and the product of their labor was, for the Pop-ist, a state of grace, not the tragedy that Karl Marx had warned against in The Communist Manifesto. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol’s pop was a declaration of love for these goodz, promulgating a new kind of romantic desire for a post-war generation, whose ability to care for other people was so stunted, that they had to enforce the dictate to love, with signs, in songs, and on protest placards. [[slnc 1000]] They even declared a Summer of Love, like a recycling campaign. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol’s insistence on the personification of the commodity, and the commodification of the person (as with his Marilyn  portrait), neatly sums up the state of l’amour in the consumer capitalist society.

[[slnc 2000]] 

“Alienation of labor” was something Marx had witnessed, with the pell mell rise of capitalism and industrialization, in his own lifetime. [[slnc 1000]] It summed up the situation of the workers, who no longer had direct relationships to the things they made. [[slnc 1000]] But Marx livvd in a time of revolutions and street actions. He saw the establishment of the Paris Commune, as well as the revolutions of 18 48, when people still felt they had agency to change their world. [[slnc 1000]] He couldn’t have predicted the dizzy heights of alienation achieved by modern capitalism. [[slnc 1000]] This alienation has only been rehabilitated and made bearable by institu­tionalized drug use (legal and illegal) at every level of society. [[slnc 1000]] Though the drug culture purports to be a rebellion, it’s actually state-mandated, and determined by the needs of Imperial policy, as well as by industry. [[slnc 1000]] The State’s narcotic prohibition was just a clever move, designed to make drug users feel empowered, special, and sexy. Sort of like Facebook’s early college only pretense.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The drugg scene that shaped US culture in the 1960s, was a direct result of the compulsory pill popping required by the army, and was mandated by the state. [[slnc 1000]] When the soldiers came home, they wanted to keep feeling the ups and downs that had transformed their service into something more interesting than just hurry up and wait. [[slnc 1000]] Life in the army, after all, is interminably boring, but it is also marked by a certain largesse. [[slnc 1000]] Soldiers are encouraged to go hor ing, engage in violence, and generally misbehave, so as to blow off steam accumulated while waiting for action that typically never comes. [[slnc 1000]] The soldier is an ob-ject with no value except for the ability to use money requisitioned for military budgets. [[slnc 1000]] They aren’t required to do anything except consume. Besides killing people during wartime. Which is relatively unusual.

[[slnc 2000]] 

As drugg culture in the USA, had martial origins, it retained particular values when it was absorbed by the counterculture. It was colored by army life, army mentality, and army preoccupations. [[slnc 1000]] The California counter culture’s main drug deelers were Hells Angels, for example, who had started life as bored itinerant ex air-force, and refused to give up the rapeyshus free lifestyle they’d experienced murdering people overseas. [[slnc 1000]] The beat­nicks who were their customers, also organized into militant cell-style cleeques, with vague insurrectionary ideologies. [[slnc 1000]] Warhol’s fabulous coterie by comparison, were ex-debutantes and social streyevers, who provided a kind of USO to the drug addled, poly­morphously perverse counterculture. [[slnc 1000]] Serving up Dada, and bitchy in jokes, too a smashed audience of sophisticaytes.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Given that drugs at the time were considered anti-work, the factory was an ironic name. [[slnc 1000]] Whether you dealt them or took them, they were an antidote to production. And, as such, the true expression of a post-industrial consumer society. [[slnc 1000]] The pill popping hedonism of the Itt girl, and the other superstars in Andy’s orbit, made for a scene that garnered considerable publicity, and became an inspiration to millions.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Indeed, because the drug is often at once a rite, an initiation, a cross to bear, and a symbol of machismo, art workers and rock n rollers often find themselves pressured to ingest copious amounts of substances that are arbitrarily illegal, so as to weave a legend. [[slnc 1000]] This tedious behavior is only superseded by the material that it produces. [[slnc 1000]] Meanwhile, these drugs are credited with much of human creativity over the past millennium, particularly during the beatnik and rock n roll period. [[slnc 1000]] This creates all kinds of problems with credit. [[slnc 1000]] Don’t let drugs get the credit due to you.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Still, drugs are central to the identity of many artists, and particularly rock groups, since they are illegal and therefore mysterious, secret, strange, macho, and highly personal. [[slnc 1000]] They are a natural fit for those modern artists who want to become a kind of gate keeper to a private club, or cult of the anointed. [[slnc 1000]] If you choose to be a drug group, some things to consider are the drugs which will be in vogue during your ascent. And what kind of music will be appropriate to serve as the soundtrack to their usage. [[slnc 1000]] The ability to predict drug trends could be an enormous asset to a group, not unlike a stockbroker knowing how to play the market effectively. [[slnc 1000]] If one can be associated with the resurgence of a particular drug (as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were with the marijuana vogue of the early 90s, or as The Grateful Dead were with LSD)  hits needn’t be produced, and the music can become a tertiary concern.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The ascendance of a particular narcotic as the itt drug of one or more subcultures shouldn’t be difficult to guess, if one maintains an awareness of geopolitical trends. [[slnc 1000]] Since availability of narcotics are controlled by the CIA, and its allies in organized crime, covert US military actions and assassinations provide a clue as to which part of the world the substances are coming from. [[slnc 1000]] The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a huge volume of heroin flooding US streets, imported through the CIA-Corsican mafia’s French Connection, via war in Southeast Asia. [[slnc 1000]] This was transported care of the C I A’s own Air America. Though it was sometimes shipped perversely in the hollowed out bodies of dead gee eyes. [[slnc 1000]] The CIA had induced the Hmong tribe in Layos to fight the communists for them, in exchange for purchasing their opium crop, and needed a captive purchasing public. [[slnc 1000]] Most of it was sold directly to gee eyes on their tours in Vietnam, but the surplus made it stateside, with devastating effects.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Heroin had become a hip trend a generation earlier in the USA, as the CIA united with the Corsican Car boney gang in Marseille, to stop the communist unions from controlling that strategic port. [[slnc 1000]] Together with French ex-Nazis, the Car boney gang used CIA and police assets to flood the US market. [[slnc 1000]] Initially, heroin was popular with jazz and Beatniks, but with its return in the Vietnam era, it spread into the rock n roll, and pop music genres.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Cocaine enjoyed enormous success in the 1970s, with war against the Sandinistas, and the CIA sponsorship of the South American juntas in Argentina, Chile, and Central America. [[slnc 1000]] The coca plant supplied the company with an enviable pile of cash for teaching torture techniques to South American police state bogey men, against labor leaders, artists, communists, innocent foreign exchange students, and whomever else these deranged freaks fingered. [[slnc 1000]] The white powder’s proliferation helped shape the disco music lifestyle, music, and morality. [[slnc 1000]] Cocaine is highly sociable, sexual, and anti-intellectual, but leads to paranoia, megalomania, insanity, worship of material luxury, and garish costumery. [[slnc 1000]] Cocaine enjoyed a resplendent comeback in the 2000s, with the USA’s Plan Columbia, leading to the sell out vacuity of 21st century indie rock, as well as the aesthetic of braggadocio and amorality, typified by that generation’s rapp stars.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Occasionally a new drug is introduced to great aploom. Like the C I As own LSD revolution, which transformed the anti-war movement into a skitzzo mystified fuzz ball. And the crack innovation, which rehabilitated the wealthy’s use of cocaine by creating a poorer, tawdrier cousin, providing the pretext for a money making war on drugs that enabled prison building and new levels of police repression against the impoverished. [[slnc 1000]] Now however, the fad for legal pharmaceuticals has bumped the predictable drug cycle out of whack. [[slnc 1000]] The old drugs are largely unnecessary, since doctors aggressively dope any stubborn interesting, or unusual person into passive conformity. [[slnc 1000]] Sometimes innovation can create drugs on a grassroots level. [[slnc 1000]] Project Pat’s famous Sizzurp is one example of a homemade drug. The Ramones championing of airplane glue is another example. And Donovan’s Mellow Yellow, the smoking of banana peels, is a third. [[slnc 1000]] These brave souls were unwilling to submit to the C I A mafia’s prescription for dependency, and created their own mind altering agents instead.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The drug your group takes will represent an aesthetic decision rather than a penchant for the drug itself. [[slnc 1000]] Groups’ identities are often closely linked to various drugs. And the group with no ideas or personality can often enlist a drug to give it one.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Record production is another kind of drug making. [[slnc 1000]] Record collectors are add icts, and the narcotic effect of pop music is widely recognized. [[slnc 1000]] The different types of music, and indeed formats, are akin to different types of drugs, with very different effects. [[slnc 1000]] Rock n roll in the 1950s and 60s was proliferated via 45s, cheap and disposable, which gave the listener a euphoric sense for a few moments, followed by a manic desire for something the same but different. [[slnc 1000]] It was essentially like crack cocaine. [[slnc 1000]] The 45 era was therefore a golden age of music, in terms of volume of good songs and dynamic groups. But the groups had to be extraordinarily concise. [[slnc 1000]] The songs were expected to deliver either a novel noise, or sensual thrill, within a few seconds of the needle hitting the vinyl. Otherwise the listener would quickly move on to a new platter.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The 45 was largely abandoned when it was replaced by actual cocaine, which proliferated massively in the 1970s. [[slnc 1000]] Or perhaps the explanation is vice versa. Cocaine was used by add icts as a stand in drug, when the industry abandoned the 45 format.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Long Playing records were more like a marijuana high. [[slnc 1000]] Double albums were heroin. [[slnc 1000]] Meditative, at 15 minutes a side, L Ps were for deep listening. [[slnc 1000]] The sides could careen up and down in mood and create a drama or narrative. [[slnc 1000]] The most successful L Ps were those like James Brown Lyve At The Apollo, or Isaac Hayes’ Hot Buttered Soul. Records that transported the listener to an unusual scenario. [[slnc 1000]] Double albums like Pink Floyd’s Ummagumma, or Bob Dylan’s Blonde on Blonde,  promised total immersion, and were in vogue in the late 1960s, coinciding with the height of heroin sheek. [[slnc 1000]] C Ds and eye pods are from the pharmaceutical era of mandatory drug use. They chatter in the background, creating an atmus­phere, but never demanding actual attention.

[[slnc 2000]] 

While drugs used to be about taking a trip, expanding horizons, des­troying the ego, or exploring consciousness, modern drugs are about making wrong things (such as supposed personality disorders) right. [[slnc 1000]] They are correctives, designed to help the user conform to normative social behavior and work modes, by ironing out hard to take behavior. [[slnc 1000]] Accordingly, modern groups are loath to have personality, being formalistically obsessed with copying the Jesus & Mary Chain, the Ramones, the Stooges, or some other group. [[slnc 1000]] Inspired by the pharmaceutical drugs, they want to be right in their decisions, correct in the way they sound, like something an influential Internet magazine has said was important. [[slnc 1000]] This is why they slavishly ape institutionalized forms.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Capitalism’s business models and economy are based on addiction. [[slnc 1000]] New models of automobiles, new styles in clothes, new sounds, new films, up-to-date telephones, refurbished kitchens, and so on. [[slnc 1000]] Drugs are just one more aspect of enforced compulsion and dependency on consumer goods. [[slnc 1000]] Groups are attempting to create a taste for their sound, which becomes a habit. An addiction of a sort. [[slnc 1000]] Designing a popular sound is akin to designing a drug. [[slnc 1000]] A  hit record is feeding a compulsion for a particular magical sound. [[slnc 1000]] For the listener, once hooked, no other sound will do.

[[slnc 2000]] 

The Internet remains the most profound contemporary drug, and one that has become an enormous influence on music. [[slnc 1000]] Internet addiction isn’t just socially tolerated, it’s aggressively encouraged. [[slnc 1000]] It leads one to a state of constant distraction, the desire for incessant stimulation, and an unquestioning trust in and worship of the authority of a monolithic webb. [[slnc 1000]] For these add icts, all answers to all questions are found from a single source. The Wikipedia. [[slnc 1000]] This monolith is a dreadful public work, which (like an ethereal version of the Egyptian pyramids)  is labored on incessantly by uncompensated, fanatical zombies. [[slnc 1000]] The Internet drug drives its fiends to create more and more of their addicting substance. The Internet itself. [[slnc 1000]] They construct new web pages, links, and what they call content. All of which make their webmasters, and other debauched Internet overlords, wealthy beyond comprehension.

[[slnc 2000]] 

People who stop taking drugs tend to replace them with coffee addiction, or obsessive behavior that they flaunt as a macho work ethic. [[slnc 1000]] This is a case of making up for lost time. [[slnc 1000]] Drugs are time consuming, and once one is not taking them it becomes apparent to the former user how much time was used up, by what is essentially a consumerist version of sleeping late.
