1. [[slnc 1000]] (Vancouver)

[[slnc 2000]] 

I am aware that there is a world out there that functions without regard to me. [[slnc 1000]] There are warrs, and budgets, and bombings. And vast dimensions of wealth and greed and ambition and corruption. [[slnc 1000]] And yet I don’t feel a part of that world, and I wouldn’t know how to join if I tried.

The consumer of contemporary visual culture, is placed within a process of looking and seeing that must begin by interrupting the ceaseless image flow of late post modernism. [[slnc 1000]] Our experience of the modern urban world is filled with visual white noise, which becomes a reverberating monotone of image and dater. [[slnc 1000]] To create pockets of stillness, or moments of being within this waterfall roar of random semiotic code, is both a personal and a cultural reflex. To create space for subjectivity to be reclaimed, individually, socially, and geopolitically. [[slnc 1000]] The point at which the mundane becomes, if not an epiphany, then a space to think within.

[[slnc 2000]]

Epiphanal moments. I’ve been thinking about them a lot lately. [[slnc 1000]] I’ve always thought of them as good things, but epiphanies can cut both ways. [[slnc 1000]] In those instants of insight, the world suddenly makes sense in a way that it hasn’t before. [[slnc 1000]] But that is not always a happy event.

4. [[slnc 1000]] (Somerset, England)

[[slnc 2000]] 

Been sorting out some stuff. [[slnc 1000]] Found some old vinyl and photos. [[slnc 1000]] Here’s one Andy took of me at The Factory, after The Cramps gigg at Max’s. [[slnc 1000]] Don’t remember much about it. [[slnc 1000]] I’d taken too many Haliborange, and snort­ed too much Trill. [[slnc 1000]] Were you there?

[[slnc 2000]] 

5. [[slnc 1000]] (Loss Angeleez)

[[slnc 2000]] 

I come to a red light, tempted to go through it. Then stop once I see a bill­board sign that I don’t remember seeing, and I look up at it. [[slnc 1000]] All it says is “Disappear Here.” [[slnc 1000]] And even though it’s probably an ad for some resort, it still freaks me out a little. And I step on the gas really hard, and the car screeches as I leave the light.

Samuel Beckett says: 

[[slnc 2000]] 

It only means that there will be a new form. And that this form will be of such a type, that it admits the chaos, and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else. [[slnc 1000]] The form and the chaos remain separate. [[slnc 1000]] The latter is not reduced to the former. [[slnc 1000]] That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation. Because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates. [[slnc 1000]] To find a form that accommodates the mess. That is the task of the artist now.

[[slnc 1000]] 

Right on.

Whatever their conceptual or aesthetic intention, any fine artistic engage­ment with the commercial imagery of mass culture, in the late postmodern period, creates a connection with its broader semmiotic context.

[[slnc 2000]] 

So now what?

[[slnc 2000]] 

By now there have been successive generations of Warhol’s children. The ones who grew up to know only a total Pop world. [[slnc 1000]] They have been the witness participants, in the rise to power, of a renewed cultural materialism, wholly enmeshed in the socio-cultural relationship between technology and consumerism. [[slnc 1000]] Cities have become monno environments. [[slnc 1000]] Mass media is fragmented into a form of virtual multi tasking, in which the lines between information, advertising and entertainment, become increasingly blurred. [[slnc 1000]] The visual culture resultant from these conditions is, by definition, accelerated and in a state of constant updating. Its tempo is anxious, enervated. [[slnc 1000]] The dew is no longer upon it. [[slnc 1000]] Rather perhaps, a clammy perspiration indicative of a steadily over-heating power source, that sickens from an illness that has yet to be defined. [[slnc 1000]] There are fewer and fewer semmiotic idiosyncrasies in what might be termed the taste and texture of the visual language of much advertising for low-cost products. [[slnc 1000]] “There is no there there,” to borrow the famous pronouncement from Gertrude Stein. [[slnc 1000]] Rather, there is flatness. [[slnc 1000]] Product shot and price, in large letters and digits, and in bright colors, become (in the subway, in the supermarket, on the magazine page) infinitely transferable exclamations. [[slnc 1000]] Their temper is declamatory, but their urgency hollowed out.

9. [[slnc 1000]] (Newcastle and Liverpool)

[[slnc 2000]] 

The second the houselights went down, the first ten roes of the audience broke ranks, and ran, hell for leather, to the front of the stage. [[slnc 1000]] Ran that is, as best as their sheath skirts, antique fox stoles, bomber jackets, platform boots, dark glasses, meticulous quoiffure and zelously upheld sense of self-possession would allow. [[slnc 1000]] They were all young, and their excited faces, red from the heat and the crush, seemed at odds with the mascara, powder, lipstick and lip gloss that was intended (in a key chain code of associative ideas) to summon up some camp, Americana, sci-fi reclamation of Betty Boop or Humphrey Bogart, by way of the Weimar decadence. [[slnc 1000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

Beneath a low, pale blue cloud of cigarette smoke, Art Deco compacts (in the middle years of the 1970s, still easily salvaged from suburban jumble sales), were produced from ancient mesh handbags, that had once been the property of flappers, who were the great aunts and grandmothers of these pop children. [[slnc 1000]] And with fingers gloved in black or cream satin, rippling up to the elbow (a diamante bracelet sitting on the wrist over the glove), young women dabbed at their cheeks and cheek bones with rouge or fern-scented white power. [[slnc 1000]] They held amber cigarette holders, or wore tortoise shell dark glasses, with celluloid lenses of mill-pond green. [[slnc 1000]] Here and there, one of their boyfriends was sporting a second hand tuxedo, its satin lining the color of vanilla ice cream. [[slnc 1000]] Spiffy net veils seemed to tumble from the front of pillbox hats. [[slnc 1000]] And all around were young people (mostly suburban and provincial), dressed in vivacious home-created ensembles, that pursued their own fantasies of modern artifice and synthetics, like stage clothes worn as street wear. [[slnc 1000]] Outlandish styles and fabrics, nearly all touched with sexual fetishism. [[slnc 1000]] Lurex and vinyl, plastic, old air hostess uniforms, scarlet high heels, greased back hair, faux leopard skin, green nail polish.

[[slnc 2000]] 

By now the drum beat had taken up a military marching rhythm. quickening the pulse, blowing a gale of rising excitement. [[slnc 1000]] In the darkness on the stage, you could just make out the pin prick beam of a roadeez torch, guiding some shadowy figures. To the side, long banners hung ceremoniously beside a bank of amps, each black monolith of which, was topped with a winking red light. As though sentient, alert. [[slnc 1000]] The kids at the front had started stamping and clapping, their shining eyes fixed unwaveringly on the center stage. [[slnc 1000]] Then, from out of nowhere, a terrific double crash on the drums was joined by the preposterous, haunting, uplifting sound of an electric oh boe, conjuring up an implausibly pastoral melody. [[slnc 1000]] Only to give way to what sounded like a reversed crescendo, deafening yet still intact. [[slnc 1000]] Whipped up into new frenzy by the screaming chords of an electric guitar, and the scything screech of an electric violin. [[slnc 1000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

The roar from the audience was deafening. [[slnc 1000]] Anyone down at the front, who happened to glance around the packed auditorium, trying somehow to imprint the scene in their memory, would have seen nothing but entranced ecstatic faces. [[slnc 1000]] In the stalls, the circle, the balcony, rising up as one mass into the twighlit corners of the old Edwardian theater. [[slnc 1000]] And as the roar intensified, the tall slick figure of the singer snaked seductively into the spotlight, center stage. [[slnc 1000]] He moved in curious, marionette movements, as if he was a film of himself that stopped and started. [[slnc 1000]] At the level of his hips, his hands chopped the air. [[slnc 1000]] Hitting the crest of the rising wave of sound, he crooned out a line that dropped down a scale with effortless finesse.

[[slnc 2000]] 

One of the other things that was important in the idea of the band, was the notion that you could make things that were serious art, and they could also be popular. [[slnc 1000]] That was the ideal. [[slnc 1000]] Not to make something obscure, that only a few people would ever see or listen to. [[slnc 1000]] The same was true for me. [[slnc 1000]] That I had made this costume, and hadn’t compromised, but had been as far out as I wanted to be. [[slnc 1000]] And it had become really popular. [[slnc 1000]] One wanted to get away from being an artist in the art world sense. [[slnc 1000]] One wanted to move out of the art world. [[slnc 1000]] So you weren’t making paintings, or making a big splash at the ICA. [[slnc 1000]] You were actually out there, in the 100 Club or wherever. In popular culture, and loads of people loving what you did. [[slnc 1000]] At the same time, it was all about elitism.

[[slnc 2000]] 

11. [[slnc 1000]] (London)

[[slnc 2000]] 

In the Golden Age. That is, the 1970s. The Phoney Wars were Style Wars [[slnc 1000]]  Style became a weapon to forge your own legend. [[slnc 1000]] Style started to be accessible in a quite unprecedented way.

12. [[slnc 1000]] (Bromley, Kent)

[[slnc 2000]] 

Barker (AKA Six) was a member of the so-called Bromley Contingent of very early followers of The Sex Pistols, and the retail and fashion work of McLaren and Westwood. [[slnc 1000]] Other members would include the musicians Suzy Sue and Steven Severin, and the writer Bertie Marshall, then known as Berlin, in homage to the perceived glamor and decadence of the Weimar republic. [[slnc 1000]] Originating from suburbia, but all determined to leave its security as soon as possible, the Bromley Contin­gent became the British sub-cultural equivalent, in many ways, of Andy Warhol’s notorious superstars. [[slnc 1000]] Volatile, at times self-destructive or cruelly elitist, but dedicated to a creed of self reinvention, and personal creativity.

[[slnc 2000]] 

13. [[slnc 1000]] (New York City)

[[slnc 2000]] 

In short, the culturati were enjoying the realism. [[slnc 1000]] Plain old bourgeois mass culture high school goober squeezing whitehead hunting can I pop it for you Billy realism! [[slnc 1000]] They looked at a Roy Lichenstein blowup of a love comic panel, showing a young blond couple with their lips parted in the moment, before a profound, tongue probing, post teen American soul kiss. [[slnc 1000]] And the hell with the sign systems, they just loved the dopey campy picture of these two vapid blond sex buds, having their love-comic romance bigger than life. Six feet by eight feet (in fact), up on the walls in an art gallery.

14. [[slnc 1000]] (London)

[[slnc 2000]] 

Red brick mansion flats. Their outline ghostly in a pale mist. Suffused by the light of a low winter sun. Rain blackened pavements, flanked by fences of corrugated iron. Old shop fronts, and pub doorways, their paintwork peeling. [[slnc 1000]] An ancient time of groceries wrapped in newspaper. [[slnc 1000]] Spuds, beans, tins of sardines, and rice pudding. [[slnc 1000]] Fags and gold top. [[slnc 1000]] Thick hair, through which clear brown eyes, like those of young children, seemed to stare, with both vacancy and intent, from pale expressionless faces. [[slnc 1000]] Heavy coats, reeking of incense and damp and pot. [[slnc 1000]] Unwashed jeans and black suede ankle boots. [[slnc 1000]] Mornings of freezing fog and fine rain. [[slnc 1000]] The Cromwell Road a dreary vista of dingy mansions, some of their high windows with rags and flags for curtains.

[[slnc 2000]] 

And endless, endlessly strange rooms. Rooms painted black. Rooms thick with the perfumed smoke of smouldering incense, and the muscular smell of pot. [[slnc 1000]] Rooms papered with posters. Rooms that opened off other rooms, down corridors which had once led to servants’ rooms and sculleries. [[slnc 1000]] Now illuminated by dim, red light bulbs, and oderiferous with mildew. [[slnc 1000]] The unchecked foliage of the overgrown garden, pushing against the windows as though to overrun the house. [[slnc 1000]] Sunlit rooms that seemed haunted by a broken promise of benign domesticity. [[slnc 1000]] Placid, long haired couples, baking bread, restoring Eden in Paddington, or Maida Vale.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Yet all had been transient, and, ultimately, illusory. [[slnc 1000]] Mere mirages in a vast expanse of squatted and rented accommodation, where nothing was ever as it seemed. [[slnc 1000]] And the only logic to be celebrated, was a switchback of contradictions and reversed affirmatives. [[slnc 1000]] When anyone, for example, had asked Edward a question, he might reply, Yes No, or, No Yes, or, Dada. [[slnc 1000]] To reverse language and action had been his favorite reflex. [[slnc 1000]] A necromantic device, some said. [[slnc 1000]] Or a hippy affectation to stick it to the Man. [[slnc 1000]] Of course, his interlocutors could never know, and were not meant to know. [[slnc 1000]] To be as slippery as spilt mercury was the aim, and then to reverse the scatter of soft hard particles into a single mass once more. [[slnc 1000]] To run alongside the windows of the bus, and hold a mirror up to the visiting tourists, as they leaned out, with their cameras.

[[slnc 2000]] 

But then Peter had reached the point where he no longer knew why the game was being played. [[slnc 1000]] And nor in truth, cared. [[slnc 1000]] Well you know, we’d all love to change your head. [[slnc 1000]] So mocking, the sharp reproach from on high. [[slnc 1000]] And so absolute. The end of an epoch. [[slnc 1000]] And then to ask himself, was he mad? And to be told, as was Alice, that we are all mad, had eventually (as the rooms and their occupants became centrifugal, with he and Sylvie clinging together in the center of their spinning maelstrom) seemed a negative affirmative too much to bear.

[[slnc 2000]] 

In his worker’s black jacket, bewildered and beaten, he had faced for a last few months, a society not simply indifferent, but hostile to radicalism. [[slnc 1000]] A people who chose not to Be Here Now, or become an Uncommon Market, or an Anti-university, or a Yes No college, with “The Cause” their campus. [[slnc 1000]] Fat chance. [[slnc 1000]] 

[[slnc 2000]] 

That would have been in 1970. [[slnc 1000]] Suddenly, after all the sound and the fury, it was over, and silence returned. [[slnc 1000]] One by one, the rebel causes swiftly fell. [[slnc 1000]] The student anger seemed to have burnt itself out. [[slnc 1000]] The protests stopped. [[slnc 1000]] There were no more sit ins. No more excited votes. And no more invasions. [[slnc 1000]] Where did it all go? [[slnc 1000]] A later historian would write: Perhaps the Old Left’s suspicions of their juniors had been correct. [[slnc 1000]] That for them, the revolution was just one more fashion. A way of enleyevening the years before one finally had to face up to real life.

[[slnc 2000]] 

Some company recently, was interested in buying my aura. [[slnc 1000]] They didn’t want my product. [[slnc 1000]] They kept saying: We want your aura. [[slnc 1000]] I never figured out what they wanted. But they were willing to pay a lot for it. [[slnc 1000]] So then I thought that if somebody was willing to pay that much for my it, I should try to figure out what it is.

[[slnc 2000]] 

I think aura is something that only somebody else can see. And they only see as much of it as they want to. [[slnc 1000]] It’s all in the other person’s eyes. [[slnc 1000]] You can only see an aura on people you don’t know very well, or don’t know at all. [[slnc 1000]] I was having dinner the other night with everybody from my office. [[slnc 1000]] The kids at the office treat me like dirt, because they know me, and they see me every day. [[slnc 1000]] But then there was this nice friend that somebody had brought along, who had never met me. [[slnc 1000]] And this kid could hardly believe that he was having dinner with me! [[slnc 1000]] Everybody else was seeing me. But he was seeing my aura.

[[slnc 2000]] 

When you just see somebody on the street, they can really have an aura. [[slnc 1000]] But then when they open their mouth, there goes the aura. [[slnc 2000]] Aura must be until you open your mouth.
